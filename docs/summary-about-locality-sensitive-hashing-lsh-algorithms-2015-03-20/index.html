<h5>[ Minutia ] <a href="%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint%22" title="Fingerprint">1</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The major minutia features of fingerprint ridges are ridge ending, bifurcation, short ridge or dot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A minutia, in the context of fingerprint descriptions, is a place where something unusual happens, such as two ridges merging or a ridge ending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minutiae and patterns are very important in the analysis of fingerprints since no two fingers have been shown to be identical <a href="%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint%22" title="Fingerprint">1</a>.</p>

<p>Global minutiae matching</p>

<h5>[Minutia Cylinder-code (MCC) representation] [2]</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MCC representation associates a local structure to each minutia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fingerprints are normalized for size and orientation, so that if we took two images of the same finger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local structure associated to a given minutia is represented by a cylinder .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local minutiae representation is based on 3D data structures (called Cylinders), built from invariant distances and angles in a neighbourhood of each minutia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>[Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)] [3]</h5>
<ul>
<li>LSH projects the data into a low-dim space; Similar items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability. Candidate pairs are those that hash to the same bucket.</li>
</ul>
<p>LSH drastically reduce the number of distances to be calculated by considering only those vectors that collide with the query vector under one or more of the hash functions.</p>

<p>Generalized LSH:  Amplify using AND-OR cascades

</li>
<li>
<p>LSH for Euclidean Distance
A set of basis functions to start LSH for Euclidean distance can be obtained by choosing random lines and projecting points onto those lines [3].  Each line is broken into fixed-length intervals, and the function answers &quot;yes&quot; to a pair of points that fall into the same interval.  Nearby points are always close and distant points are rarely in the same bucket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Exact Euclidean LSH (E2LSH)] [4]
E2LSH package provides a randomized solution for the high-dim near neighbour problem in the Euclidean space.</p>
