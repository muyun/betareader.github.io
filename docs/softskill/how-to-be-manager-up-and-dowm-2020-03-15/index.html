<h4>Giving Feedback - in a way that was helpful and direct, but also kind and thoughtful</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask first</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>so that the person can be mentally prepared for it ahead of time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Would you like to hear a suggestion?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Do u mind if I give you feedback?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or start off by asking them &quot;How do u think it went? what do u think was good, what could we improve&quot;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>compliment + criticism + compliment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The work you ... good; &quot; + &quot;However, ..., it might be better&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>be timely</p>
<ul>
<li>feedback is more effective when it is at the time of the event</li>
<li>If too much time has elasped, use judgement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make it about the task, not the person</p>
<ul>
<li>like <strong>&quot;Adding headers to the email would make it easier to read&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Give suggestions</strong> on how to improve</p>
<ul>
<li>tell them how - <strong>give them examples and ideas</strong> on how to make something better</li>
<li>more actionable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a personal example</p>
<ul>
<li>easier to receive is to make the recipient feel like they are not the only one making the mistake</li>
<li><strong>&quot;I learned this the hard way&quot;</strong> or &quot;<strong>I used to do the same thing</strong>&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide people <strong>the &quot;why&quot;</strong> behind your suggestions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the person to defend/vent/explain</p>
<ul>
<li>the receiving party may react by defending or justifying their approach</li>
<li>if that, <strong>just listen and allow them</strong> to say their piece</li>
<li>more ofthen than not they will still make the changes, but <strong>knowing that you heard their side of things will make them feel better</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>把事情的前因后果说清楚</strong>， 同时明确告知需要执行的事项</p>

<h4>Learning to coach and delegate</h4>
<ul>
<li>you are not just be the person who is the expert, you will be <strong>someone who makes everyone better</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>The art of <strong>delegating</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>change your mindset</p>
<ul>
<li>have to focus on growth and education, not necessarily efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt a leader:leader model instead of a leader:follower</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a good leaders means allowing the people around you to be the experts in their domains</li>
<li><strong>transform my team to stop asking me questions</strong>, and <strong>instead make recommendations and ask for permission</strong></li>
<li><strong>encourage your teammates to take more ownership</strong> and lead their own arenas</li>
<li>like &quot;What do you think I would say&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't look for perfection</p>
<ul>
<li>open to the differences and you accept that other people may not do things the same way you would</li>
<li>If worried about quality, define your quality up front when you assign the task</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup some guard rails</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>try to <strong>identify what information you need to feel good</strong> about the progress, and then <strong>the best way to
get the information</strong> without being overbearing or micromanaging the details.</p>
<ul>
<li>like setup daily status meetings to go voer progress, bi-weekly code reviews to go over implementation, or weekly one-on-ones with other people on the project</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help them come up with a plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>have them draft up a plan</strong> and bring it back to you</li>
<li><strong>Go over their approach together, give them feedback</strong> (like asking good questions)</li>
<li>When <strong>you can draft the idea together</strong>, you will feel more confident in their approach and they will be able to <strong>leverage your expertise and direction</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead them to figure it out</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lead them down your steps or your thought process on how you would solve the problem, not just give them the solution</li>
<li><strong>&quot;what have you tried so far?&quot;</strong></li>
<li>&quot;What have you considered tyring&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What did you research? Did you find anything?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;And then finally, have you tried looking up ...&quot;&quot; (you would look for to find the anser)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>start small</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>start with something that is easy to do</li>
<li>find things that maybe aren't urgent but are small, iterative improvements that would be easy introduction into your realm of responsibility</li>

<h3>your manager</h3>
<h4>treat your manager as a coach, not as a judge</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>主动向老板寻求反馈；主动问问上司，你的哪些工作令他们印象深刻，还有哪些方面需要改进</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>定期要求与之会面，定期了解他对你的看法</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>把重点放在应该完成哪些目标上， 更好地了解管理层对自己的期望，不仅涉及日常工作，还包括长期思维</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>自己的事情主动跟进，有什么问题就跟老板说，讨论， 如果不是自己管辖范围内的事情，别人开心就好
这里最重要的是你对你提出的问题已经找到合适的解决方案。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes your job to help the entreprenuer find a reasonable solution which is merely hard and gets most of what they wanted. A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.</p>
</li>
