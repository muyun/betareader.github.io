<h4>Why Algorithms ?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Programs = Data structures + Algorithms</li>
<li>Avi Wigderson gives that &quot;Algorithms has becoming a common language for understanding nature, human, and computer&quot; .  Algorithms as computational models are replacing math models in scientific inquiry . People are developing computational models to stimulate what might be happening in nature in order to try to better understand it. Algorithms play an extremely important role in this process .</li>
</ul>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Priority Queues is a data type to find the largest M items in a
stream of N items (Constrict: Not enough memory to store N items).</p>
<h4>priority-queue implementation based on the binary heap</h4>
<p>Using priority queues is similar to using queues and stacks
but implementing them efficiently is more challenging.  We consider a
classic priority-queue implementation based on the <strong>binary heap</strong>
data structure, where items are kept in an array, subject to certain
ordering constraints that allow for <strong>efficient (log-time)
implementations</strong> of remove the maximum and insert.</p>
<p>We use array representation of a heap-ordered complete binary tree.
Because array implementation <strong>does not waste any space on the usual
pointers</strong> you have in a tree to traverse between parents and
children. The reason is that we're able to <strong>keep this binary tree as
balanced as possible</strong>, we don't need pointers to figure out the parents
and children. we can just read that off directly from the position in
the array.</p>
<h4>binary heap</h4>
<p>The binary heap is that <strong>parent's key no smaller than children's key</strong>, that's (k is the index),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>set a[k] to a[k/2] when we move up the tree</p>
<p>set a[k] to a[2*k] or a[2*k+1] when move down the tree</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can take advantage of the capability to move up and down paths in
the tree without pointers and have guaranteed <strong>logarithmic performance</strong>
because the height of a complete binary tree of size N is lgN.</p>
<p>The basic algorithm swim (bottom-up reheapify) moves up the heap until we reach a node with a larger key, or the root; The function swim(int k)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The sink algorithm movs down the heap until we reach a node with both children smaller(or equal,) or the bottom; The function sink(int k)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The insert algorithm requires no more than 1 + lgN compares, which involving <strong>moving along a path between the root and the bottom of the heap</strong> whose number of links is no more than lgN; the function insert(key x)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The heap algorithms require no more than 2lgN compares for remove the maximum; The operation involves moving the heap path no more than lgN, and it requires two compares for each node on the path (except at the bottom): one to find the child with larger key, the other to decide whether that child needs to be promoted; The function delMax()</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4>Performance Analysis:</h4>
<p>For typical applications that <strong>require a large number of intermixed insert and remove the maximum/min operations</strong> in a large priority queue, the elementary implementations using an ordered array or an unordered array require linear time for one of the operations, a heap-based implementation provides a guarantee that both operations complete in <strong>logarithmic time</strong>.</p>
