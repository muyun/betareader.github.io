<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>offer solutions and flag issues  </p>
<ul>
<li>"this is a problem. I suggest doing X."  </li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Turn complaints into opportunities  </p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>treat your manager as a <strong>coach</strong>, not as a judge</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>主动向老板寻求反馈  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>主动问问上司</strong>，你的哪些工作令他们印象深刻，还有哪些方面需要改进 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>定期要求与之会面，定期了解他对你的看法    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>把重点放在应该完成哪些目标上， <strong>更好地了解管理层对自己的期望</strong>，不仅涉及日常工作，还包括长期思维</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>自己的事情主动跟进，有什么问题就跟老板说，讨论， 如果不是自己管辖范围内的事情，别人开心就好
这里最重要的是你对你提出的问题已经找到合适的解决方案。  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes your job to help the entreprenuer <strong>find a reasonable solution</strong> which is merely hard and <strong>gets most of what they wanted</strong>. A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>how to mange down</h3>
<h4>Giving Feedback - in a way that was helpful and direct, but also kind and thoughtful</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask first</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>so that the person can be mentally prepared for it ahead of time  </li>
<li>"Would you like to hear a suggestion?"  </li>
<li>
<p>"Do u mind if I give you feedback?"  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or start off by asking them "How do u think it went? what do u think was good, what could we improve"  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>compliment + criticism + compliment</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>"The work you ... good; " + "However, ..., it might be better"  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>be timely  </p>
<ul>
<li>feedback is more effective when it is at the time of the event  </li>
<li>If too much time has elasped, use judgement  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make it about the task, not the person  </p>
<ul>
<li>like <strong>"Adding headers to the email would make it easier to read"</strong>    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Give suggestions</strong> on how to improve  </p>
<ul>
<li>tell them how - <strong>give them examples and ideas</strong> on how to make something better  </li>
<li>more actionable </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a personal example  </p>
<ul>
<li>easier to receive is to make the recipient feel like they are not the only one making the mistake  </li>
<li><strong>"I learned this the hard way"</strong> or "<strong>I used to do the same thing</strong>"  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide people <strong>the "why"</strong> behind your suggestions  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the person to defend/vent/explain  </p>
<ul>
<li>the receiving party may react by defending or justifying their approach  </li>
<li>if that, <strong>just listen and allow them</strong> to say their piece  </li>
<li>more ofthen than not they will still make the changes, but <strong>knowing that you heard their side of things will make them feel better</strong>    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>把事情的前因后果说清楚</strong>， 同时明确告知需要执行的事项  </p>

<h4>Learning to coach and delegate</h4>
<ul>
<li>you are not just be the person who is the expert, 
    you will be <strong>someone who makes everyone better</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>The art of <strong>delegating</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>change your mindset </p>
<ul>
<li>have to <strong>focus on growth and education</strong>, not necessarily efficiency. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt a <strong>leader:leader</strong> model instead of a leader:follower    </p>
<ul>
<li>Being a good leaders means allowing the people around you to be the experts in their domains   </li>
<li><strong>transform my team to stop asking me questions</strong>, and <strong>instead make recommendations and ask for permission</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>encourage your teammates to take more ownership</strong> and lead their own areas    </li>
<li>like "What do you think I would say"  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't look for perfection  </p>
<ul>
<li>open to the differences and you accept that other people may not do things the same way you would  </li>
<li>If worried about quality, define your quality up front when you assign the task </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup some guard rails</strong>    </p>
<ul>
<li>try to <strong>identify what information you need to feel good</strong> about the progress, and then <strong>the best way to get the information</strong> without being overbearing or micromanaging the details  <ul>
<li>like setup daily status meetings to go over progress, bi-weekly code reviews to go over implementation, or weekly one-on-ones with other people on the project  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help them come up with a plan</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>have them draft up a plan</strong> and bring it back to you   </li>
<li><strong>Go over their approach together, give them feedback</strong> (like asking good questions)  </li>
<li>When <strong>you can draft the idea together</strong>, you will feel more confident in their approach and they will be able to <strong>leverage your expertise and direction</strong>    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead them to figure it out</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>lead them down your steps or your thought process on how you would solve the problem, not just give them the solution  </li>
<li><strong>"what have you tried so far?"</strong>  </li>
<li>"What have you considered trying" </li>
<li>"What did you research? Did you find anything?" </li>
<li>"And then finally, have you tried looking up ..."" (you would look for to find the answer)  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>start small</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li>start with something that is easy to do </li>
<li>find things that maybe aren't urgent but are small, iterative improvements that would be easy introduction into your realm of responsibility  </li>
