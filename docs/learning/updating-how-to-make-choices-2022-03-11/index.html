<h4>basic rules</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Golden Mean</strong> -  a balance between our rationality and our animal drives   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>confident yet courteous</strong> (polite and showing respect)  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>knowing you're worth</strong> and also be kind (humble and <strong>don't look down on</strong> others)  </li>
<li>warmth and competence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>appreciate the needs of the others</strong> while we need to <strong>advance our own interests and concerns</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>too much empathy(feeling the other person's emotions)</strong> making deep cooperation when they're likely to be exploited  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust but verify  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>think carefully about what we do not want to believe</strong>,
and <strong>what we want to believe</strong>, before we place our trust in others <ul>
<li><strong>establish a baseline (what constitutes "normal" behaviors)</strong>, and start to ask pressing questions</li>
<li><strong>actively look for those clues</strong> we hope not to find  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>become true to yourself  </li>
<li><strong>only concentrate on matters truly important to you</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training your boundaries to be stronger than your heart  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>俗文化</strong>： 显示的比实际的要弱一些  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set yourself free from fear</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>already been living through the worst times  </li>
<li>the freedom would empower one to face failure courageously   </li>
<li>see this as an opportunity to be a new start    </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>THE Self-Awareness Onion</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>understanding of one's emotions</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>identify blind spots</strong> in ourselves and the <strong>expressing the affected emotions</strong> appropriately  </li>
<li>[2020-06-16-notes-on-the-love-skills]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>why we feel certain emotions</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>why do you fell angry?  is it because you failed?</li>
<li>help us <strong>understand the root cause of the emothions</strong> that overwhelm us </li>
<li>do something to change it </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the third level is <strong>what you value, and how you measure failure/success</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>what standard I am judging myself</strong> and everyone around me  </li>
<li><strong>our values determine the nature of our problems</strong>, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives  <ul>
<li>if you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>"<strong>why does that seem true</strong>?" </p>
<ul>
<li>"why do I consider this to be success/failure?"</li>
<li>" How am I choosing to measure myself?" </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>some good values  - <strong>reality-based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>the values are achieved <strong>internally</strong>, and can be experienced right now</li>
<li>good values: honesty, curiosity, creativity, standing up for oneself,nonviolence  </li>
<li>bad values: dominance through manipulation or violence, being liked by everyone, ...   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>why</strong> or for what purpose?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-improvement is about: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>prioritizing better values</strong>, <strong>choosing better things</strong> to give</li>
<li>when you give better fucks, you get better problems  </li>
<li>when you get better problems, you get a better life  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>making good decisions</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concentrate on the <strong>few important ones</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li>the problem is <strong>a generic situation</strong>, and could only be solved through a decision
which established a rule, a principle  </li>
<li><strong>clear specifications</strong> to what the decisions has to accomplish  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>focus on the process</strong> of making a decision  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>emotions</strong> are crucial in helping us come to a decision  </li>
<li>need to <strong>listen to our feelings</strong>   <ul>
<li>some of <strong>our deep-deated emotional reactions</strong> might come from
those aspects of <strong>our personality that we are not able to change</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>the heart</strong> has its reasons which reason does not know  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>use a pros and cons list  </p>
