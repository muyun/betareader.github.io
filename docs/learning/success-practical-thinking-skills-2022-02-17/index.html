<h5>Aristotle  - a successful life is <strong>a life of fullilled happiness</strong></h5>

<li>
<p><strong>happiness comes through achieving the best version of you</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>everything has its unique nature and function in the nature order  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when an object <strong>fulfills the function of its kind to the highest level</strong>, 
it achieves a sort of <strong>functional excellence</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>strive for functional excellence would be the ultimate purpose or final end</strong> of the existence of anything in the universe   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>aim at the excellence you possess</strong> is indeed the very source of your long-term happiness - eudaimonia  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an ultimate purpose for our existence in the universe is about <strong>the development of our potentials and talents</strong> as humans  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>success belongs only to those <strong>who manifest the virtue of character</strong>  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>only people with the genuine excellence would achieve happiness</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Golden Mean</strong> - <strong>a balance between our rationality and our animal drives</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>do it just right</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>do the right thing in the right way at the right time in the right place to the right person  </li>
<li>don't do too much, and don't do too little  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>use <strong>common senste</strong> to start with, then we <strong>learn through trial and error</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>observe and learn from good examples</strong>, and being excellence <strong>takes practice</strong>  </li>
<li>don't be disappointed at your failures  <ul>

<h5>Immanuel knat - Moral values - right and wrong</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The moral law is categorical imperative  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>thinking rationally</strong> is the only thing that tells us what is right and wrong  <ul>
<li>not god, not other people, not our gut feelings  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>the sophisticated reasoning skills direct us to make the right choices in life</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>how can we <strong>use reason to know what is right</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Act only on "categorical imperative"  - <strong>a universal law</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>an unconditional commitment</strong>  </li>
<li>avoid beging affected by any personal concerns or self-interests  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>a genuinely morally good person only if he acted unconditionally</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Treat others as you want to be treated</strong>  as a goal  </p>
<ul>
<li>being moral isn't easy, but it's not impossible, it's a matter of free choice  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>need to know the intention of the agent</strong> before you can make a fair moral judgment  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>how a moral life forms the core of a successful life  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>integrity and honesty  -  lying is always wrong </p>
<ul>
<li>because lying couldn't be universalized as a moral right for everyone  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>respect people  as an individual - <strong>the humanity principle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>every human being has value in dignity  </li>
<li>do not use people <strong>only as a tool for you to gain</strong> something </li>
<li>they are aleady complete - they are ends in themselves  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>respect your humanity</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>recognize and respect whatever is included in your humanity</li>
<li>cultivate your own talents</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>self-love and rational optimism</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>respect the value of your own life</strong>  </li>
<li>more than a tool to help you avoid pain or obtain happiness </li>
<li><strong>have self-love by looking for solutions</strong>     </li>
<li><strong>solutions are always there if you keep looking</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
