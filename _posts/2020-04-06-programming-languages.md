#### Interpreters on 2023

program - parse -> abstract-syntax-tree - eval -> result

[sspy.py](https://github.com/muyun/dev.wic/blob/master/sspy.py) - a tiny scheme interpreter with python - shows the details.

#### Python Data Model -> A Framework/API for core language constructs

We can leverage the Python Data Model to build new classes.

By using and implementing **special methods of Python Data Model in your objects**, your objects can **behave like the built-in types**, enabling the expressive coding style **Pythonic**. You will find that your intuition applies everywhere.

##### Data Sturctures

-   sequences - Python sequences are often categorized as **mutalbe or immutable**, and also could be considered as **flat sequences and container sequences**.

    -   flat sequences like str, bytes, array.array store the value of its contents in its own memory space

        -   more compact because of the physically store the value

    -   container sequences like list, tuple, and collections.deque

        -   hold **references** to the objects

    -   **list** -> mutable and mixed-type

        -   list comprehensions and generator expression
        -   given a list t, list(t) must create a new copy of t

    -   **tuples** as immutable lists

        -   tuple(t) just **returns a reference to the same t**, there's no copy here
        -   a tuple's length will never change, and a tuple uses less memory than a list

    -   array.array -> efficient because of only **the packed bytes for numeric data**
        -   for large sequences of numbers, this saves a lot of memory
        -   NumPy lib

-   collections

    -   dict and set

        -   **hash tables** are the engines for the high performance dicts
        -   hash tables must be sparse to work, they are **not space efficient**, compared to a low-level array a pointers to its elements (more compact but also much lower to search)

    -   Data class as a collection of fields

-   str versus bytes

-   Variables are mere labels
    -   the parameters in the function are **aliases** of the actual arguments

##### Functions as objects

-   Functions, like integers, strings, and dictionaries, also can be a **program entity**, this enables programming in a **functional style**.
    -   The main idea is to assign functions to variables, pass them to other functions, store them in data structures and access function attributes.
-   function decorators and closures
    -   a decorator like _deco_ is a function with the decorated function parameter _func_

```python
target = deco(target)
```

```python
def deco(func):
    def inner():
        print("running inner()")
    return inner

@deco
def target():
    print("running target()")
    return
```

##### Object Oriented

-   duck typing
    -   it's a sequence because it implements the necessary sequence methods

##### Iteration

-   iterator

    -   iterables have a _**iter**()_ method that builds a new iterator each time.
    -   iteators implement a _**next**()_ method that returns individual items

-   **Generators are iterators** that produce the values passed to _yield_

    -   yield -> return the generator object

        -   yield pauses the function and saves the local state so that it can be resumed right where it left off

    -   a generator function _gen_ab_ builds a generator object gen_ab() that
        implements the iterator interface

```python
def gen_ab():
    yield 'A'
    yield 'B'
```

-   Concurrency

##### Context Managers

-   context manager objects exist to control a _with_ statement

    -   The context manager interface consists of the _**enter**_ and _**exit**_ methods

    -   using _@contextmanager_ decorator instead of creating a class and implementing the interface _**enter**/**exit**_ methods

##### generators as coroutines

##### Metaprogramming

#### Standard ML

-   functional programming

-   sml-ch1

    -   syntax is how you write sth
    -   **semantics** is what that something means

        -   **Type-checking** rules (before program runs) in current static environment
            -   what type a binding has
            -   produces a type or fail

    -   **Evaluating** the bindings (in the dynamic environment)

        -   a value or an error or an infinite loop of the preceding bindings
        -   look up value in current dynamic environment

    -   **idioms** are the common approaches to using langguage features

        -   Recursion
        -   Let -> local binding

    -   libraries

        -   standard

    -   tools

        -   REPL -> quick try-something-out
        -   debugger

    -   **immutation data**
        -   **it is just a mapping, not assignment statement**, a tuple, or a list
        -   No constructs for mutating the data we have build. No way to change the contents of a binding, a tuple,or a list
        -   don't worry about the alias or copy like in java
        -   or, like java, you have to care whether alias or copy, and in order to avoid the mutable data is been changed

-   sml-ch2

    -   tuples are syntactic sugar for records with field names 1, 2, ...

    -   type synonyms -> a convenience for talking about types
    -   datatypes bindings

        -   patter-matching over one-of types
        -   better to use pattern-matching to access list and option

    -   patter matching over **each-of types**

        -   value binding -> a val-binding **can use a pattern**, not just a variable
        -   function binding

            -   in ML, every function takes **exactly one tuple arg**, implemented with a tuple pattern in the function binding
            -   a **function argument** can also be a pattern

        -   Type-checker can **figure out the types of things you're matching against**,
            no longer need to write down any explicit types for the arguments to functions or any variables

        -   type inference
            -   **more general** can replace its type variables consistently

    -   nested pattern-matching

        -   elegantly recursive

    -   **Recursion**
        -   **tail-recursive** -> recursive calls are tail-calls
        -   call-stacks -> pop the caller before the call, allowing callee to reuse the same stack space

-   sml-ch3
    -   first-class functions
    -   TODO

#### notes

-   Reload modules problem in Emacs Python Shell

    -   use importlib to reload(models)
    -   or use ipython and %autoreload

-   virtualenvs setup for python3 -> pipenv

    -   New a project: >pipenv --python 3.6
    -   Install all dependencies: >pipenv install
    -   Locate the virtualenv: >pipenv --venv
    -   Use the shell: >pipenv shell
    -   Uninstall everything: >pipenv uninstall --all

-   <del>Your environment contains PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    This doesn't work with Python 3 for obvious reasons. To remove it: unset PYTHONPATH
    </del>
