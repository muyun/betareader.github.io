Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong. I am a freelance project (IT/BUSINESS) consultant in Hong Kong now. I enjoys working with startups.

I was a Technical Officer in HSUHK, RA (in Chinese University of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Baptist University), and Software Engineer in Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia Corporation) and HKCREO (a Fintech startup).

I got my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong and B.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering at WuHan University.

All opinions here are my own.
