Hi, I'm Raymond, educating in engineering and business fields have taught me to be good at novel solutions to difficult problems. Thanks to the experience of working on a range of projects from telecommunication to web application to data science, I have learned to adapt to any challenge and uncertainty that come my way.

I’d like to hear from you.   
<br> <br> 

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-improvement, and experiencing something new.
