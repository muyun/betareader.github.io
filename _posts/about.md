Hi, I'm _muyun, a Computer Engineer & Scientist based in Hong Kong.   
<br>     

I like problem solving, and reading.  I write at [blog.reader](https://muyun.github.io/).    
<br> 

You can find some of my [projects](https://github.com/muyun). If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss, I’d be happy to hear from you. 

I am also available for project consulting.  You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_muyun).
<br> <br> 

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-development, and experiencing something such as nature, art, local cultures. 
<br> <br>
