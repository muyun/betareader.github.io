Hi, I'm Raymond, Educating in engineering and business fields has taught me to always be curious and that every problem has a solution. Thanks to the experience of working on a range of projects from telecommunication to web application to data science, I have learned to adapt to any challenge that comes my way. My wide range of experience and skills makes me good at novel solutions to difficult problems. I can work well with challenges and uncertainty.

I’d like to hear from you.

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-improvement, and experiencing something new.
