Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong. I am a freelance Technical Product Specialist in Hong Kong now.
I like working on product, engineering, culture, and the related business.

I was a Technical Officer in HSUHK, RA in (Chinese University of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Baptist University), and Lead Software Engineer in HKCREO (a Fintech startup) and Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia Corporation) .

I got my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong and B.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering at WuHan University.

If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at **bestraymond@icloud.com**. I’d be happy to hear from you.
