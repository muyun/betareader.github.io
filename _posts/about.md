Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong. I am a Technical Product Specialist and Founder@Bean in Hong Kong. I like working on product, engineering, culture, and the related business.

I was a Technology Officer in HSUHK, RA in (CUHK, CityU, and HKBU), and Lead Software Engineer in HKCREO (a Fintech startup) and Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia Corporation) .

I got my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong and B.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering at WuHan University.

You can see some of my project [here](https://github.com/raymondworkshop). If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at **bestraymond@icloud.com**. I’d be happy to hear from you.
