Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong. I am a software engineer who enjoys working on engineering, product, culture, and diversity.  

I am a RA at Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before this, I was a technical officer in HSUHK, RA in City University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Baptist University, and Software Engineer in Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia Corporation) and HKCREO (a Fintech startup).

I’d like to hear from you.
