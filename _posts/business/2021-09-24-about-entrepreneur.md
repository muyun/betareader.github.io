#### How Entrepreneurial Thinking and Acting  
* hero  
    - 模仿，关键是**你得找到自己的声音**  
        + be true yourself  
    - 英雄是 凡人，却**创下了远远超越凡人经验之外的成就**，以至于死后留下不朽的记忆    
        + 英雄未必是善的； 犯下了不可饶恕的罪恶的人也可以是“英雄”  
        + 英雄是**点燃你的生命热情的人**； 英雄**以一种非凡的方式践行你所珍视的价值**  

    - **深入研究一种既定的做事方式**，
    并探讨这些事能否以更低成本，更快速度和更能激动人心的方式来做？  

    - 在开放环境下，只要迭代成长不被打断，就可以超越目标  

*  Weekly **self-reflection**  
    - help you **digest or really think about your experiences**, and **relate them to general patterns**   
        +  **record your thoughtful analysis of the new insights or ideas**  

    - your intent should not be to merely describe what happened,
    but **to explore WHY it happened**, and **what it means**  
        +  "**what new insights** did you gain from the week's session? " 
        "**what new ideas** did it provoke?"  
        "**how do these insights or ideas** relate to your work environment and to your career goals and objectives?   

* Field Observations with Fresh Eyes  
    - **think like a traveler** 
 
    - **look for unmet needs for  consumers** to identify new product opportunities, rather than design a new product based on pre-specified needs  
    - **observe your customers in their natural environment**
        + their actions, interactions, wants and needs - and **note what you find**    
        + **what underlying need prompts** this behavior
        + what alternatives exist for the customer to use  


* Deine your opportunity  
    
    - the Business Concept   
        + define your idea and **what customer value** it will bring  
            - what is the product or service we intend to offer?  
            - who are the potential customers?  
            - how will we meet the goals and remain operational?  


    - Personal Goals  
        + **understand the effort, cost and benefit**  

        + why you and why now and how you to develop and lead the initiative you are proposing? 
            - **why am I doing this**? 
            - **what will this do to me or require from me**?   
        

    - Business Goals    
        + **how you will organize for success & competition**  

        + highlight the proposed business and revenue model and competitive advantages  

    - insights  
        + **treat life as an experiment** - Tom Kelley  
            - when starting new ventures, you have to be willing to take risks,
        make mistakes, and **learn from these mistakes**  
        + Opportunities are everywhere  


* Refine opportunity  
    - TODO

#### **make one friend** 
* nurturing a relationship with one person  
    - don't view the friendships as a barter trade  
    - find a person **who you can learn from or who you appreciate truly**
    - **meetup, exchange ideas** and become good friends  
    - be a giver  


#### have time to think  
* free yourself from the day activities as much as possible  
    - put them on autopilot  
    - **Missing the big picture** is a big sin in your business    
    - when you have  time to think, **think long-term**  

 

#### **greet first**  
* greet firstly before they did  
    - you always count on **good manners** to save a deal  


#### how to hire the smart one  
* work with them before you hire them  
    - a domain advisor for a short period  
    - so you can know how they work with your team,
  and how good they get into your company's mission  

 

#### bring in **positivity** 
* enter with a smile and with people 

* people draw energy from u
