    - help you **digest or really think about your experiences**, and **relate them to general patterns**   
        +  **record your thoughtful analysis of the new insights or ideas**  

    - your intent should not be to merely describe what happened,
    but **to explore WHY it happened**, and **what it means**  
        +  "**what new insights** did you gain from the week's session? " 
        "**what new ideas** did it provoke?"  
        "**how do these insights or ideas** relate to your work environment and to your career goals and objectives?   

* Field Observations with Fresh Eyes

    - **observe your customers in their natural environment**
        + their actions, interactions, wants and needs - and **note what you find**

            - how will we meet the goals and remain operational?  


    - Personal Goals  
        + **understand the effort, cost and benefit**  

        + why you and why now and how you to develop and lead the initiative you are proposing? 
            - **why am I doing this**? 
            - **what will this do to me or require from me**?   
        

    - Business Goals    
        + **how you will organize for success & competition**  

        + highlight the proposed business and revenue model and competitive advantages

#### **How to get Rich**  
* **Wealth is assets and business that can earn** while you sleep  
    - the purpose of wealth is **freedom**  

    - **ethical wealth creation makes abundance for everybody**  
        + it's **a positive sum game** but **there are competitive elements** to it  
        + the modern industrial economies are much more heavily wealth-based societies  

  
    - Overall capitalism (Free markets) are **intrinsic to the human species**  
        + the notion of **exchange**, and **keeping track of credits and debits** is built to us as flexible social animals    
        + **keeping track of credits and debits** lets us **cooperate**  
            - who put in how much work?  
            - who contributed how much?  

        + Capitalism is actually good
            - it gets hijacked by **improper yields**, where you have **corruption**, or you have **monopolies**  
            - 商人被污名化 - 官商 - （垄断+腐败）   

    - Money is how we transfer wealth  
        + money is **social credits**; it's **the ability to have credits and debits of other poeple's time**  

    - Status is your rank in the **social hierarchy**         
        + stauts is a zero-sum game; to win you have to put somebody else down   
        + politics is an example of a status game  


* **You won't get rich renting out your time**    
    - you can't earn **non-linearly**  
        + your inputs are matched to your outputs  
        + you are replaceable because you're now **doing a set role**    
            - you're not being creative   
    - they're just **not gonna pay you enough**  
        + they pay you the bare min that thay have to, to get you to do their job   
        + they take on the risk, the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand 
  
    - You must **own equity** to gain your financial freedom  
        + the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors  


    - You want **a career where your inputs don't match your outputs**  
        + **Tools and leverage** are what create the disconnection between inputs and outputs  
            - look for **things** that are leveraged  
            - the higher the **creativity component** of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs  


    - Ideally, **make your money in discrete lumps**  
        + your own lifestyle does not have a chance to adapt quickly  
        + have much more creative expression, and much less about money  


* You will get rich by **giving society what it wants,but doesn't yet know how to get at scale**      
     - **Society always wants new things**, and society will pay you for creating things that it wants  
        + But society doesn't yet know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn't nee you  

        + figure out **what you can provide**, figure out **how to build that**, and then they figured out **how to scale it**  

    - **Bring the high end to the mass market**   
        + distribute what rich people used to have to everybody  

        + **Entrepreneurship**  
            - predict that society will want it  
                + you create it just because you want it  

            - figure out how to scale it  
                + how to get it to other people in a profitable way, in a self-sustaining way  


*  The Internet allows you to **scale any niche interest**    
    - you can now reach everyone  

* **Play longterm games with longterm people**  
    - all the benefits in life come from **compound interests**  
    - in a longterm game, it's **positive sum**  
        + high trust will make it easier to play the game  
        + important to pick an industry/city where you can play long-term games, and with long-term people  

    - get traction, and never fall back  

  
* Pick partners with **high intelligence, energy and integrity**   
    - some who is smart **at that thing**  
    - some who is **motivated** (hard working)  
        + delegation - someone **wants to do what you want them to do**    
    - **high-integrity**  
        + **Integrity is what someone does**, despite what they say they do  
            - cheat  
        + **self-esteem** is the reputation that **you have with yourself**    
            - self-esteem is to your own internal moral code of ethics  

        + pay attention to **subtle signals**  
            - Signals are what people do despite what they say    

    - Partner with **rational optimists**  
        +  you have to see the world for what it really is  
        +  you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done  

        + have an **action bias** towards getting what you want  
            - **just do things**  
                + figure out if sth is viable or not by **doing it**  
                + at least do the first step, and the second step, and **then decide**    
            - **Either lead, follow, or get out of the way**  

        +  Don't partner with pessimists and cynics  
            - modern society is far, far **safer**  
            - their beliefs are self-fulfilling  
            - they just wanna tell you why the thing is not going to work  


* Arm Yourself with Specific Knowledge  
    - Specific Knowledge is **the knowledge that you care about**  
        + specific knowledge is found more by pursuing your innate talents,
        your genuine curiosity, and your passion  
        + your specific knowledge is often **observed** by other people **who know you well and revealed in situations rahter** than something that you come up with  
            - **look back on your own life and see what you're actually good at**  

        + look at what you have already built by that point, and then **you can build on top of it**  

        + follow your own obsession, and keep an eye out for the commercial aspects of it  

* builder and seller  
    - CTO  
        + builder  
        + understand enough  
    - CEO

        + speaking skills - persuasive and communicative  
            - writing skills  
            - sales skills actually scale better over time  
           
        
* **reading** is the foundation for your self-education    
    - you need creativity, you **need the ability to feed your own brain to learn whatever you want**    
    - **take your natural path** and **just read the things that interest you** until you kind of understand them  

    - **read the original scientific books** in a field  
        + the foundations are Math and Logic  
            - when you understand **the scientific method**, then you can understand how to separate truth from falsehood 
        + you can absorb what is true, you can reject what is false, and **you have a basis for even working that out that is logical and scientific** and not purely just based on opinions  
        
    - **understanding that comes through repetition and through usage and through logic and foundations** that really makes you a smart thinker  

    - foucs on the foundations  
        + basic concepts from game theory, psychology, ethics, math, computers, and logic will serve you much better  

    - you can **learn better by doing iterations** on the job  


* **Embrace Accountability** to get leverage  
    - accountability is results-focused  
    - build up **credibility** to get following labors and money  

    - in modern society, **the downside risk is not that large**    


* You need **specific knowledge and accountability** and **you have a good name** in that domain      
    - then people are going to give you capital as a form of leverage that you can use to then go get more capital  
    - Labor and Capital are old leverage  
    - **want the min amount of people working with you** that are going to allow you to use the other forms of leverage  

    - Capitcal as a leverage because it **feels unfair**, and nobody else around them or necessarily sharing in it  


* **Software and media** are New Leverage   
    - tech startups 
        + **robot**, and code lets you tell them what to do  

    - coding, writing books, podcasts/youtubing, are **permissionless**    
        + you don't need anyone's permission to do them  
        + for labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you; 
          for capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest  

    - **code and media turns into a positive sum game**    
        +  creating wealth with product leads to **more ethical wealth**  
            - **those products are equally available to everybody** as opposed to trying to create your wealth through labor or capital  

        + with the largest budget, you get the highest quality  
            - it's the nature of code and media output that the same product is accessible to everybody  

* **Pick a Business Model with Leverage**  
    - **Scale economies**  
        + the more you produce, the cheaper it gets  
            - this **builds up an automatic barrier** to entry against competition  

        + **low marginal cost** of reproduction  
            - like media 

    - **Network effects** - **value grows** as the square of the customers    
        + you want to be **in a network effects business**, assuming you're not number two  
            - create little hooks for users to add value to each other    
            - how your customers add value to each other   


* Judgment Is the most important skill  
    - **get leverage**  
        + code or media (writing/language)  
    - then **your judgment** really maters  
        + know the long-term effects of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that  
        + judgment/wisdom comes from experience, and can be acceleated through short **iterations**  



* Find **product-founder-market** fit   
    - search for what to do  
        + **your objective and skills** converage to make you the best    
            - **keep changing your objective** until it arrives at your specific knowledge, skill sets, position, capabilities, location and interests  

            - "**I want to be the best at what I do**"  
            - "**What I do is flexible, so that I'm the best at it**"  

        + arrive at **a comfortable place where you feel**    
            - "**This is something I can be amazing at, while still being authentic to who I am**"  

        + "what should I be doing?"  
        + "where is a market emerging?"  
        + "where is a market emerging?" 
        + "what's a product I can build that I'm excited to work on"  
        + "where I have specific knowledge?"  

    - pick **the right people** to work  
        + **surround yourself with the best people** possible  
        + pick the people with the hightest intelligence, energy and integrity that you can find  

    - work hard and **value your time**    
        + anything you have to do, get it done  
        + If I discover a problem, I'll get on it, right then and there, and solve it  

        + need free time and a free mind  
            - being busy will destroy your ability to do great things  
            - * **Outsource something** for less than your hourly rate  


        
* Escape Competition through Authenticity  
    -  you **have to adjust** until you find product-market fit  
        + at least **lean towards authenticity**, towards getting away from competition  
        + the business and product they create are **authentic to their desires and means**    
    - **the masses are never right in entrepreneurship**


* apply specific knowledge, with leverage, with judgment, to get what you deserve  
    - product-market fit  
        + **what am I really good at**, accordign to observation and people I trust
        + the market wants it?  

    - Avoid people who got rich quickly  
        + they're just giving you their winning lottery ticket numbers  
        +  you have to **examine everything**, and have your own point of view    
            - **is it true**? 
            - is it true outside of the context of how that person applied it?  
            - is it true in my context? 
            - **do I want to apply it**?  

* A Calm Mind, a Fit Body, a House Full of Love  
    - Money will solve all your money problems  
        + **Money buys you freedom** in the material world  
        + money lets you not do the things you don't want to do 

    - your health, your mental health, and your close relationships  

    - calmer internal state  


* **Productize yourself** and work for yourself     
    - Figure out **what you're uniquely good at**, and apply as much leverage as possible  
        + Am I productizing it?   
        + **Am I scaling with labor or capital or code or media**?  

    - Look up **the value chain to find leverage**  
        + see how they are **taking advantage of the time and work you're doing** and how they're **applying leverage**  

        + you want to manage **more capital, products, meida and community**  
            - people want to move up naturally to manage other people  

        + every founder has to lie to every employee  


    - Work for yourself  
        + the best relationships are **peer relationships**  
            - if there's someone above you, that's someone to **learn from**  
            - if there's somebody below you, it's because you're **teaching them and enabling them**   

        +  **one that makes you money**   
            - reading and making money, 
            - working with startups 

        + one that keeps you fit  

        + one that makes you creative  

* Being Ethical is Long-Term Greedy  
    - Trust leads to compounding relationships  


* **Principal-Agent Problem**: Act like an owner  
    - **A principal is an owner**; an agent is an employee 

    - A principal's incentives are different than an agent's incentives  
        + you have to **get the incentives right to get people to behave correctly**  
            - almost all human behavior can **be explained by incentives**  
            - **People are much more honest with their actions** than they are with their words  
            - the good ones are not just looking for **money**, they're also looking for **things like status and meaning in what they do**  
        + when you do deals, it's **better to have the same incentives**  

    - **Train yourself how to think like a principal**  
        + the best way to operate is to ask **"What would the founder do?"**  
        + think like the owner and act like the owner  

    -  **Deal with small firms** to avoid the principal-agent problem  
        + the agent doesn't care much and you end up getting substandard service  
        + **work with boutiques**; the accountability is extremely high  

    - Think big  
        + it **takes as much effort to create a small business as a large one**  

    - Don't **bet everything on one big gamble**    


* **Compounding Relationships** make life easier  
    - Turn short-term games into long-term games  
        + Negotiation is about not wanting it too badly  
        + if someone is taking advantage of you in a negotiation, your best option is to **turn it from a short-term game into a long-term game**  

        + "i'm going to do this project with you, and I have three friends who want projects done who are waiting to see the outcome of this project."  

    - **relationships offer a good example of compound interest**    
        + mutual trust, you know that person's got your back  

        + it's better to **have a few compounding relationships** than many shallow ones  


* Finding Time to invest in yourself  
    - **try to be innovative in the context of your job**, **take on new challenges and responsibilities**    
        + find the part of the job with the steepest learning curve  
        + avoid repetitive drudgery 

    - develop **a founder mentality**    

    - **take on accountability**    
        + take on accountability and solve problems on the edge of knowledge that others can't solve, **people will line up behind you**. **The leverage will come**.  
        + "Hey, I'll take charge of this thing that nobody wants to take charge of"  

    - Scale your specific knowledge with **apprentices**  
        + Specific knowledge comes on the job, not in a classroom
