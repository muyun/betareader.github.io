#### notes  
* software business  

*  work in small teams/companies with the lean members    


*  对于 “不确定性大的事情” 的选择    
   - 这个选择会不会**扩大视野，加深认知**    
   - 你到底在害怕什么？  
   - **认真地做当下能做的最好的选择**，未来就会是它最好的样子； 放下对未来的期待和担忧  

* **ownership and result** (责任和风险)  
   - **Entrepreneurs tolerate uncertainty** more than any other profession  

   - self-taught, skilled, emotion-intelligent, in shape, **energetic**, focuses on internal control  
       + **learning by doing** > learning by asking for advice  

   - 不是 insight, 也不是 execution  
   
   - **I define it**, although I respect you  

   - 愿意 出面担当，在不确定的项目中，冒着犯错的风险尝试  
       + 大多华裔，太怕犯错，不敢担责，不敢为人先，之在后面嘀咕  

   - work with people **I respect and like**  
       + **只需要说服愿意去相信你和支持你的那一部分人**即可，并和他们一起工作就可以；
   没有必要说服所有人  
       + **把重心放在 证明你自己的能力和判断上**；无须为别人的无知和傲慢负责
