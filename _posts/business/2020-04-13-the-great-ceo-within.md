### notes

-   维持创造者思维， creation is about building

    -   维持创造者思维，专注于 **将脑中的想法转变为可工作的最小实现**的过程
    -   **an app is an act of self-expression**, the same way a novel, a painting, a lego starship, or a gourmet meal is
        -   The difference is you can distribute your app to millions of people from your spare room over a phone line, so **the potential impact of your creation is enormous**
        -   you can do the same with a blog post or an ebook, but a software app is a utility as well as a work of art. If you make a great one, **it can become an intimate part of your users' everyday life**, like their fork or belt.

-   learn how to **propose better solutions**

    -   the first thing you should do is **define the problem**,
        **your idea** for the solution, **your target user base**
    -   **Do your research**. **know all the existing solutions out there**,
        and **exactly how your spec is different and better**

    -   start mocking up screens. Get in deep

    -   **defining great specifications** is a more important part of creating digital tools than writing the code itself

        -   **what your one-sentence description will be** when your app appears in a store
