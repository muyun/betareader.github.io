#### notes 

##### **make one friend** 
* nurturing a relationship with one person  
  - don't view the friendships as a barter trade  
  - find a person **who you can learn from or who you appreciate truly**
  - **meetup, exchange ideas** and become good friends  
  - be a giver  


##### have time to think  
* free yourself from the day activities as much as possible  
  - put them on autopilot  
  - **Missing the big picture** is a big sin in your business    
  - when you have  time to think, **think long-term**  

 

##### **greet first**  
* greet firstly before they did  
  - you always count on **good manners** to save a deal  


##### how to hire the smart one  
* work with them before you hire them  
  - a domain advisor for a short period  
  - so you can know how they work with your team,
  and how good they get into your company's mission  

 

##### bring in **positivity** 
* enter with a smile and with people 

* people draw energy from u
