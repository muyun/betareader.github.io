#### Journey Mastery  

##### Dealing with Change and Homeostasis    
* Getting energy for mastery  
    - human energy comes into existence through use  
    - **maintain physical fitness**  
    
* **Accentuate the positive** and **acknowledge the negative**   
    - a positive attitude and **positive feedback and praise**   

    - **Once you've dealt with the negative**, **you're free to concentrate on the best in yourself**  
        + **facing the truth and then moving on**   
        + **describing what's wrong with your life to a good friend** can make you feel better and more energetic  
        + **avoid teachers and supervisors who are highly critical in a negative sense**  
            - tell people what they're doing wrong while telling what they're doing right  
            - like "**Here's what I like about what you're doing, and here's how you might improve it**."  

* **telling the truth**  
    - **truth-telling works best when it involves revealing your own feelings**, 
    **not when used to insult others and to get your own way**    
    - **just say what we want to say**; we don't have to spend a lot of time and energy not saying something  
        + people's energy is devoted to deceiving and hiding and remembering  
        + reduce in mistakes and increase in productivity  

* **respect but don't indulge your own dark side**  
    - **feel your anger rising**, you can choose to work on a favorite project,
    or to **transmute** the energy beneath your anger to fuel 

* **Set your priorities**  
    - **indecision leads to inaction** -> leads to low energy, depression, despair  
    - in terms of energy, **it's better to make a wrong choice than none at all**  
        + **list your priorities - for the day, for the week, for the month, for the lifetime**  
        + set priorities by dividing the items 
        + **take time for wise planning, and move, keep moving**  


* aware of **the alarm bells**, and **prepare for serious negotiations**  
    - know **how much you enjoy and profit from the change**    

* practice the activity **on a regular basis**    
    - not so much for the sake of achieving an external goal as **simply for its own sake**    

* develop a **support** system  
    - people you can **share the joys and perils of the change** you're making  
    - people who can **tell their own stories of change and listen to yours** 
    - people **have gone through or are going through a similar process** 
    - people will **brace you up** when you start to backslide and encourage you when you don't  

##### Loving the plateau  
* Practice, the path of mastery, exists only in the present  
    - you can **see it, hear it, smell it, feel it**  
    - "soften my breathing and bring me a feeling of peace"  
    - "when I get started, **there's a wonderful sense of well-being**. I like to feel myself plodding along.  **when it's going good, I feel 'this is the essential me.'** **It's the routine itself that feeds me**. If I didn't do it, I'd be betraying the essential me"  


##### ch5 - **Learning** from a master teacher   
* seek the best guidance available  
    - counselors, books, or a sympathetic, unbiased friends  

* a master teacher at the beginning of the learning process
    - credentials
    - **humility,  patience,  empathy**  
        + focus on the interaction    
        **proceed through praise**? 
        show respect for the student  

* keep the proper psychological distance  
    - too far, there's no chance for the surrender to your teacher 
    - too close, lose all perspective and become a disciple rather than a student  


##### ch6 - Practice  - master the commonplace  
* **feel yourself**  
    - **maintain full awareness of** each of your movements  
    - let the awareness extend to **your own mental, physical, and emotional** condition  

* **stay balanced, centered, and focused on the process** rather than pressing impatiently for completion  
    
* the feel  
    - have the feel - the knowledge and experience - necessary to 
    **appreciate the subtleties and endless possibilities contained** within even the most rudimentary technique  

    - you'll find it to be a vivid place, **with its ups and downs,its challenges and comforts, its surprises, disappointments, and unconditional joys**  
        + you 'll take your share of bumps and bruises while traveling - **bruises of the ego as well as of the body, mind, and spirit** - but it might well turn out to be **the most reliable thing in your life**  

##### ch7 - **surrender** to your teacher, not as a guru  
* **surrender to your teacher and to the fundamentals of the art**  
    - invoke the spirit of the fool    
    - **show more respect** for his teachers; 
    carry himself with an air of **calm sincerity** and **unfailingly aware of everything going on around him**, **without a hint of ostentation**    

* the essence of boredom is to be found in **the obsessive search for novelty**   
    - satisfaction lies in **the discovery of endless richness in subtle variations** on familiar themes  
    
* There are only **learners**  
    - **cultivate the mind and heart of the beginning at every stage along the way**  

##### ch8 - Intentionality    
* cultivate a positive attitude  
    - mental toughness -> focus on a problem or a long-term gaol  
    - openness and imagination -> see options and visualize desired states  

* **hold the vision or the feeling in their mind**, and then practice it over and over  
    - **the mental image is vividly clear and when I can somehow "feel"** my fingers  moving  
    
    - **the transformation** from the feeling of the skill to be learned in the mind 
        + combine exercises in deep relaxation with vivid mental imaging of the skill to be learned  

    - Never hit a shot without **first clearly visualizing** the ball's perfect flight 
    and its triumphant destination   

##### ch9 - explore the Edge   
* open to experience, to challenge previous limits, to take risks  

* masters share her stupid, heroic desire to use herself to the limit, 
    to finish at all cost, to attain the unattainable

* 只需記住最简单的定义即可
* **把学到的理论放到实践的情境中理解**
* **找人指导你实践并寻求反馈**
    - 更能从实践的失败里得到有建设性的反馈

* 将反馈得到的新知识运用到下一次实践中
