#### Journey Mastery  

##### Learning from a master teacher   
* a master teacher at the beginning of the learning process
    - credentials
    - **humility,  patience,  empathy**  
        + focus on the interaction    
        **proceed through praise**? 
        show respect for the student  

* keep the proper psychological distance  
    - too far, there's no chance for the surrender to your teacher 
    - too close, lose all perspective and become a disciple rather than a student

#### 实践学习法  - 边做边学  - 实践-反馈-实践-反馈
* 只需記住最简单的定义即可
* **把学到的理论放到实践的情境中理解**
* **找人指导你实践并寻求反馈**
   - 更能从实践的失败里得到有建设性的反馈

* 将反馈得到的新知识运用到下一次实践中
* 再次找人指导你实践并寻求反馈
