##### Persuasive Communication  

* TODO  

* reference  
    - [The Art of Persuasion](https://alison.com/topic/learn/103806/persuasive-communication-learning-outcomes)


##### Effective Communication  
* seek to **understand the other person's perspectives**  instead of judging them definitely  
    - **try asking questions about why** someone said something or acted the way they did  instead of reacting  

    - **表达自己的同时，也融入对方的世界**， 并**巧妙地提取精华，再延伸至自己表达的内容里**  
        + 交谈中穿插自己的经历，这么一来，就会是在描述这几年自己的经验，
        再加上技巧 切入对方的过去来提出问题 （具体而本质的问题）  

    - 与朋友交谈时**了解没有被过滤的真实**， 与陌生人交流是**进入对方的语境**  


* create a **supportive workplace**     
    - help those feel **valued and needed**  

    - **Start gently**    
        + simply asking
        "**how are you feeling today**?"  
        "how was your weekend?"  
        "how's that assignment going?"  
        or "are you still stressed about your kids" 

    - talk to a colleague one to one  
        + **listen and watch for signs** that they are struggling before talking to someone  
        + **ask whether and how you can help** to support them  


    - use supportive language  
        + "**I don't know what you're going through**, but I would like to help you. **Is there any way that I can**?"  
        + "**I wonder if a doctor might be able to help you**."  


* communication goals  
    - convey our ideas  
        + grab **attention**  
            - surprising, puzzle  
            - emotional  - **individual stories** trigger empathy  
        + send a message  
            - simple  
                + focus on a **single** message  
            - memorable  
                + tell a story  

            - persuasive  
                + authority, experience  

    - gather information   
        + **ask questions and listening to those answers** rather than focusing on
        trying to just get our ideas out  
        + ask questions      
            - **move narrative forward**  
                + "and what happened next?"  
            - pause to **ensure understanding**  
                + "do you know what I mean?"  
                + "how did you know who was calling?"  

            - questions can guide people and plant ideas  

        + questions  
            - general question  
                + "what can you tell me about it?"  
            - positive assumption question  
                + "it doesn't have any problems, does it?"  
            - **negative assumption question**  when you presume a problem  
                + "what problems does it have?"  

            - we **wanna presume a problem**, and we're then more likely to gather more (using **nagative assumption question**);  
                + **seek disconfirming information**   
                + "what medications have you missed?"  
                + "what challenges are you facing meeting this deadline?"  

        + active listening  
            - speak less   
            - **encourage** a counterpart to expand on their responses  
                + "tell me more about ..."  
                + "i'd like to hear more ... "  

            - demo interest both verbal and non-verbal  
                + **encourage** - indicate your **presence and attention**  
                    - "uh-huh" "yes" "right" "go on" "ok"  
                + non-verbal  
                    - **mirroring**    
                    - **repeating the last few words** or gist of the counterpart 
                + probe further  
                    - summarize information  
                    - demo perspective taking  
                    - seek clarification   
                    - "**let me make sure I understand what you're saying** ... 
                    **but** the current values are missing ... (pushing more information)"


    - nonverbal communication  
        + low-context cultures 
            - rely on content of message (european, usa)  
            - **how things are said** dramatically influence the meaning of what's said  

        + high-context cultures  
            - infer information from context  


    - build relationships  


* how to disagree with someone  
    - first, **state what you do agree on**;
    then, **slowly introduce the disagreements** (by introducing what you agree on first,the other person is primed to think: "ok, this person agrees with me
    on a bunch of stuff, so maybe I should take him/her seriously")  

    - **put your disagreements in the form of questions**, rahter than statements 
        + for example, you might ask the person you're disagreeing with:
        "**what would it look like if** your idea played out for the next 10 years?" 
        

 
#####  compete and cooperate

    - dynamic instability    

* balance between motivation and satisfaction  
    - **finding your balance**   
    - favorable comparisons: volunteering, increases happiness  
    - unfavorable comparisons  
        + can push you to great efforts  

    - negotiation process  
        + target -> motivating  
        + reservation price  -> satisfied  

    - assess if the comparison is **in/out of order**  
        + **if the expected comparison outcome that was anticipated**?  
        + if we are competitors, what do we expect?  
        
    - **provide new opportunities to compete in the future**    
        + those comparisons are going to be less intense  

* cultures  
    - face cultures  
        + people derive their **self worth from earning the respect of others**  
        + 面子  

    - dignity cultures  
        + believe in **speaking their mind** and **being self-reliant**  
        + their **self worth is self determined** and they are very comfortable engaging in **direct, rational, fact-based conversation**

    - **identify suspicious cues**  
        + probe further
