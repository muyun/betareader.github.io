        it achieves a sort of **functional excellence**  
        + **strive for functional excellence would be the ultimate purpose or final end** of the existence of anything in the universe

### 关于实证主义哲学和生活方式 

#### 从证实 到证伪  
* **可证伪性**  
    - 现在科学 从发现正确 到 **试错中前进**  
    - 现在正确的，将来都可能是错误的    
 
* sicence needs to fail  
    - To move forward, **science needs to fail**, which runs counter to our human desire for certainty    
    - rahter than give up, we struggle along a scale of process. 
    The journey to **understand more** about the mysteries of the world and **explain them with reason is the core of our nature**    

#### **experienced or seen** rather than theory    

*  实证主义    
    - **发现一个新现象， 到依据这一新发现形成一个假设**， 再到发送一个新探测器去检测这一假设  

*  判例法  
    - **经验主义**  - **依靠感官认识世界， 再进行“归纳思维”**， 不同于 理性主义  
        + 司法更加能动性  
        + **更能 “反馈” 以及适应社会动态**  
    - **更 “稳定和延续性”**， 更有助于确保商人的基本人权  

    - 普通法 向 成文法 靠拢 （成文法（议会的法律） 优于 普通法 （法院的规定）  
        + 在民主化的背景下 但保证法制  


*  经验主义  -> 实证主义的方法论 -> **实验科学**  
    - 从观察事件入手，**从经验观察出发**， 通过精确描述，推断出自然规律， 进而证实这些事件  
    - **通过观察归纳建立一个理论后，在该理论基础上进行演绎推理，预测可能的现象； 然后通过实证检验为这个理论及其演绎寻找**  -> Bayesian  
        + **先有碎片而后不断构建框架**  
        + **不断根据新的碎片 修正甚至打破旧的框架 并构建新的框架**， 开始比较慢，但最终会后来居上 
            - 先有框架后有碎片，容易上手，开始会看上去遥遥领先，但后面就僵化而无法增长  
            - 框架固化后 最大坏处 是容易偏执的去 “占小便宜吃大亏”， 因为已经成为本

    - observe -> find patterns -> create a short-cut framework -> realize your framework sucks 
        + ask open-ended quesitons  
        + seeing some patterns in the answers  
        + make a framework from these patterns. now I can make decisions quickly  
        + wait, this is a situation my framework does not account for  

    - **证伪主义** -> 科学的工作就是 通过寻找不符合理论的观察/实验 来对理论进行证伪  


* 理性主义  
    - 理性推论而非经验观察提供最确实的理论知识体系  
    - 知识仅仅存在于完美的独立世界； 我们感受的世界，是对完美知识世界的部分复制  
    - 演绎推理  


* 自由市場 vs 计划经济  
    - 自由市场 是**动态均衡**， 强调 事后纠正  
    - 计划经济 事静态均衡， 强调 事前计划  


* 道德  
    - 纳粹和社会主义者, 都**将问题于答案之间的起因和细节全部忽略**  
    - 只由**问题的现象直接跳跃到 道德的答案**  
        + 将一切问题引向为道德层  
        + 不需要你自己百分百干净（道德评判）， 只要看你说的**是否有道理或是事实**，无论你是否别有用心，否则再干净也不行  

* cognitive vs emotional intelligence  
    - one cognitive factor is an analytical thinking style  - thinking  
        + tend to act according to reason rather than intuition  
    
    - **emotional intelligence** - feeling   
        + easily discern the emotions and motives of others 


#### Empiricism  
from John Locke to David Hume    


#### Rationalism  
from plato, Aristotle, Descartes, to Gottfried Leibuiz  
 

#### Bayesian vs frequentist
