####  总结自[思考的技术](http://book.douban.com/subject/3138847/)

* 不要把假设和结论混为一谈; **搜集证据,印证假设到导出真正结论过程中的逻辑思考**  
  
* 认清现象和原因的不同; **很多都不是原因,而是现象(结果)**  
    - 在许多个案中,真正的原因只有其中一个,而其他只是这个原因导致的现象  
  
  
* **如果发现自己的假设是错的,重新做假设,再次出发就行了**  
    - **一直悔恨自己的人生,与固执于错误的假设是一样没有意义的**  
  
  
* 在提出假设的阶段,真正的成败挑战才登场  
    - **解决问题的能力,就是为印证假设不辞辛苦的行动力**  
    - **给出的建议中,只要有一个就足够了**  
  
  
* **逻辑思考的基础在于累积事实,如果呈现的是事实,就一定要虚心接受**  
    - **当自己的意见和对方不同时,以秉持事实为证的信念**  
  
  
* 线性思考行不通; 科学的方法是**问为什么,理由**  
    - **真的是这样吗? 才是工作的开始,要听的是论点**  
    - 一个问题有数百个变量,且随时间而变化,所以答案不唯一; 要准确做出判断几乎不可能 ,但是**以科学的方法思考,则可做整体的控制**  
    - 现在已进入像叶子不知会掉落何处的复杂体系中,几乎所有问题都没有答案  
    - **培养孩子养成动脑思考的习惯,让孩子对无解的问题设法提出假设,并不厌其烦努力证明自己的假设是否正确**  
  
    
*  世界上许多问题本来就没有答案; 那些**忠于自己,能够找出属于自己的答案的人,其生命力比起已经习惯别人给出答案的人,一定更为强韧**  
    - **就算没有答案,也会自己提出假设,反复求证,直到找出答案**; 不管碰到任何困难,都勇于接受挑战,坚持到底,才是教育的根本    
    - **思考方式,重视的是如何才能导出结论**,而不是有没有知识  
    - **以假设前提进行回答,有前提就有结论的思考模式**; 对问题的前提先做个明确的假设,若前提错误,可以改变前提再回答  
     
     
*  **不太需要思考的事,尽量减少思考,且绝不没事自寻烦恼,生活要非常简单,把能规律化的事情规律化**  
    - **训练自己常保持好奇心,和别人接触的机会增长见识**  
    - 做一些可以让自己生存下去的投资,**请问你成长了多少**   
    - 最伤脑筋的是**做什么事都半途而废的人**  
    - **碰到自己没有遇到过的问题时,尝试解决**  
    - **常常提出质疑,然后找出问题的解决方法**

#### Friend & Foe  

##### ch1 - balance between feeling good about ourselves and feeling motivated to perform well  
* find the right social comparison balance  
    - **help us understand how well we are doing** is by looking at others  
    - anticipate the possibility that our successes will upset others  
        + be modest is to **share negative information**

       
* use social comparison to **boost your own motivation**   
    - seek unfavorable comparisons if you wanna push yourself harder  
        + light a competitive fire, consider those who have accomplished a bit more than you have 

    - seek favorable comparisons if you wanna feel happier 
        + consider those who are less fortunate, volunteering for those less fortunate  


##### ch2 - to be confident but also deferential  
* **confident yet courteous** (polite and showing respect)  
    - **knowing you're worth** and also be kind (humble and **don't look down on** others)  

* **combine power and perspective-taking**  
    - power **makes us more confident and optimistic**; and helps us reach our destination faster  
    - need some mechanism for keeping our egos in check  
        + **the ability to take another's perspective**   

* **perspective-taking**  
    - understand **the other's wants and needs**, what they are thinking  
        + consciously choosing to actively get inside the head of another person  
            - ask more critical **"why" and "what" questions**  
            - **use facial and bodily mimicry** to facilitate perspective-taking  
            - people like being mimicked; **mimickers seem cooperative**    

        + **appreciate the needs of the others** while we need to **advance our own interests and concerns**  
        + **too much empathy** making deep cooperation when they're likely to be exploited  
            - **empathy (feeling the other person's emotions) is less effective** in a negotiation than is perspective-taking     

    - figure out when perspective-taking helps us and when it hurts  
        + **perspective-taking without any empathy is dangerous**    


* to be confident  
    - **the feeling of power** like a king, we are more likely to act like one  
        + **your experience of your own power** can matter as much how much power you actually have 
        + recalling an experience with power, taking on a powerful posture    
        + one primed with power displayed greater **confidence**, and thus viewed as **more capable and competent**  
        + power blinds us to the plight of others  

    - **know you're worth**  


##### ch3 - Hierarchy <- harness the benefits of hierarchy while mitigating its downsides    
* **Hierarchy can produce the coordination effectively to implement and produce the well-conceived decision**   
    - managers **set direction and facilitate collaboration**    
    - **Hierarchy offers needed structure** in the face of chaos (threatening or little control)
        + **Hierarchy helps achieve the collaborative coordination** by suppressing individual desires and synchronizing behavior  
        + **Hierarchy helps people know who does what, when, and how**; **these rules promote efficient interactions by setting clear expectations** for the behaviors of people of different ranks  
        + **co-leadership is a bad idea**; this creates uncertainty over who is really in charge;
        the actions of two equally powerful people can be especially difficult to coordinate  

    - **how much the group performance requires coordination** between the members  
        + when in interdependent settings, more talent can lead to bad group performace  
        + when individuals perform largely independent tasks, it's better have enough talent  


* how and when to fluctuate between more versus less hierarchy    
    - **leaders need to create psychological safety to encourage broad participation**; 
    and a leader **sets the vision and the course and integrates all the different perspectives** to make the best decisions  
        +  we need everyone's perspective in **a complex and dynamic decision-making**  
        +  leaders and members need to **communicate frequently and coordinate** not only physically but also intellectually  
        + **speak up and alert leaders** to changing conditions and impending problems  
    
    - promote **Psychological safety** for the lower-status members  
        + **team members feel encouraged** to ask for clarification, to point out critical errors, and even to share new and challenging ideas  
        + leaders **need access to the most complete and varied information**; to ensure the perspectives and wisdom of the less powerful are brought to light  



##### ch6 - Trust <- balance between warmth and competence  
* build warmth  
    - **demonstrate concern** for others 
        + we **trust warm people**, because they care about us  
        + **feel emotion on the inside**, and express warmth effectively on the outside  
        + like "I'm sorry about the rain" shows **concern and conveys warmth**
        + **nonverbal cues** -  like **physical connection** like handshakes, an embrace, 
    a pat on the shoulder, or even a light touch on an elbow    

    - **a little vulnerability** makes you seem approachable and warm in less time  
        + like "spilling their coffee" or "telling a bad joke"  
 

* we **trust competent people**, because they are credible, effective, and efficient  
    - **use the right terms and jargon** to appear competent  
    - our deeds match our words -> hypocrite  

* are you "like me" or not?  
    - trust those who are "in" our group  
    - introduce a common enemy  

* **asking for advice**  
    - seeking advice and another's perspective can lead to long-term benefits 
    makes people **feel committed to your success** (an investment).  
    - we just flattered someone by seeking their advice **if the request is not completely obvious**  
        + asking for advice shows deference and respect  
    - follow up with everyone of your advice givers and **let them know how much their insights have helped**    
        + if you didn't take their advice, it was **their insight that helped you think about your situation in a different light**, and that their unique perspective turned out to be essential for your success  

    - self-promotion doesn't always work very well    
    

##### balance between trust and deception    
* **think carefully about what we do not want to believe**  
    - **establish a baseline (what constitutes "normal" behaviors)**, and start to ask pressing questions
      
    - **actively look for those clues** we hope not to find  

    - **think carefully about what we do not want to believe**,
    and **what we want to believe**, before we place our trust in others  
         


* Trust but verify  

* **deception**  
    - **intentionally misleads a target** 

* balance between telling the truth and being kind  
    - how important is it to **boost a person's self-esteem**  
    - how useful is the feedback for their long-term success ?  


##### ch10 - explore the mechanics of **when and how to begin a competition**
*  know **the nature of the competition**    
    - if names are listed sequentially, like voting, be listed first  
    - if it is a serial competition with more than a few candidates (like an interview process), go later and preferably last  
    - if it is a yes/no decision, know the default. if the default is unfavorable to you, go first. If the default is favorable, go last  

* **a well-informed negotiator does better by going first**  
    - take the time to **gain more information** - the item/industry, your opponent's preferences  
    - making the first offer **anchors the negotiation in our favor**  
   

#### Strategic study and thinking  

##### classify the problems  
* **define the problem**    
    - **how to best formulate a problem** 
    - **try to be more specific** if the problem concerns how a goal or target   
    - whether **the problem so-defined is real or not**  

*  classify the problem  
    - **empirical questions** -> concern empirical facts, particular events or causal processes in the world  
        + **need observations or experiments** or the help of experts in the field  
        + the prior beliefs **should be evaluated** according to empirical data  

    - conceptual questions 
        + conceptual analysis and reasoning is enough to answer 
        + without engaging in experiments or observations  

    - evaluative questions  - value judgments  
        + distinction between intrinsic and instrumental values  
        + consider **the consequences** of the action, or **the motives** behind the action  
        + once **knowing the empirical facts**, then we can **apply the correct moral standards to judge** whether the action is good or bad  


##### **solve problems**  
* understand the problem  
    - **is the problem well-defined**?  can the problem be analysed into smaller sub-problems?  
    - what type of problem is it?  
    - **what information can we gather** about the problem?  
    - **have other people solve this problem before**?  **what lessons** might their experiences offer?  
    - what are **the constraints** (time, money, resources,etc) in solving the problem?  

* draw up a plan  
    - carry out **necessary preparations**, like research, coordination  
    - **determine the time and resources needed**  
    - write down **the plan in a systematic manner**  

* try out the plan  
    - **monitor progress** to make sure that things go according to plan  
    - **record errors or special considerations** for furutre review   

* **monitor the outcome of  the plan**  
    - **review past experiences and understand why** we succeed or fail 
    - **monitor our own performance review the whole exercise** in order that
    we can do even better in the future  

* understand complex systems and processes  
    - **decomposition**    
        + identify the functions of different components,
        and see how they interact with each other  
        +  understand the function and behavior of a object in terms
    of **its components and their interaction**   


##### making good decisions  
* **focus on the process** of making a decision  
    - **emotions** are crucial in helping us come to a decision  
    - need to **listen to our feelings** because we often
    have to live with the decisions that we have made  
        + some of **our deep-deated emotional reactions** might come from
        those aspects of **our personality that we are not able to change**  
    - **the heart** has its reasons which reason does not know  

* use a pros and cons list  
    - good reasons or good consequences 

* spend more time thinking carefully about a difficult and important decision

#### critical thinking  - 思辨能力  
* think clearly and rationally  

##### Why 
* 拒绝不恰当的想法，以**更加接近真理与真相**
