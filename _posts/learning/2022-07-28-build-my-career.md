##### **Strategies on career**  
*  从执行层面，**到战术层面，再到战略层面的过程**    
    - 执行层的工作经验达到一个临界点后，**所带来的价值增量就开始衰减**，
    无法抵消年龄增长所带来的劣势，还有技术发展取代人力的趋势威胁  

* an **exciting & meaningful mission** to help channelize energy & thoughts 
    - build a purpose  
        + identify a clear mission, and head toward it 
    - let the mission channelize all your inward, latent energy   

* plan B  
    - **尽量丰富自己的选择**，不要“把所有鸡蛋放在一个篮子里”，无论是**生活方式**，**思考方式**，**工作方式**，**职业生涯**，还是**资产配置**  

* build business - do more - **action > theory** 

* build a business
    - you learn how things really work by **doing them**.
    - **experiment with the reality**
    - **engage in stimulating conversations**
    - don't just read about financial markerts, business, science, philosophy
    - **if anything is worth doing, do it with all your heart**

* **survival of the fittest**, not the strongest
    - 要想 “**适应这个群体吗**?”, “**在这个群体中是什么角色**?”,   而不是 “我要比人强”
    - 做事情, **要思考是不是适应**, 而不是完全和别人拼强弱
    -  发现一个自己的生态位, **找到自己在生态中的位置**


* master some **skill, interest, or knowledge that others find valuable**
    - once you master it, you'll be rewarded with new opportunities
    - don't try to find your passion


* **Always choose the more difficult path**: it leads to the easier life.
    - courage, social skills, friendships


* **求同存异** - **共赢 + 不失原则的妥协**
    - **共同的，不同的和处于中间带**的观点

* > Don't fight to win all the battles, you **just need win the war**
    > - 不需要赢得每场战斗，而是要赢整个战争， **过程中的妥协不丢脸，赢在最后才是最重要的**

* >  **关注事实胜过关注争吵**，**关心细节胜过关心策略**  
    > - 怀疑的精神特别重要，就是尽量不要去人云亦云； 自己去看了，自己有所体会了，再下这样的论断

* > 究竟做什么并不重要, 为什么要做这件事 以及 如何做这件事才是最重要的
    > - **why, and how** is more important than what


* **Nature and markets**, not people,  are more honest when it comes to giving feedback


#### notes on your work  
* involve a open source project  


##### notes on your career  -> **ample income** + **providing satisfaction**      
* **TIME** I spend, and **a high savings rate** as the seeds of wealth is a requirement   

* three Paths  -> financially independent  
    - the high-income-producing, high-level leadership path  -> senior executives of public corporations  
    - the self-employed, risk-taking, investing-in-my-business approach  -> owners/managers of successful businesses  
    - the frugal, steady-as-she-goes journey  

* Solution -> one matches between  **skills, abilities,characteristics and the environment/market**  
    - **understanding of our own strengths and weaknesses**  
        + **Recognize my strengths** and **creating goals** as a starting point  
    - finding a career that **makes full use of one's competencies  like skills, abilities,characteristics**   
    - if you love your job, if it provides you with **the life-style** and **level of freedom you desire**, then working is great   
        + learn **what it's like to work** so you can check the field was of interest to you  
        + whether survive in **the type of environments/market**    
        + whether like **the work you are doing** 
        + check what we liked and didn't like about work, what we are interested in and able to do  


* **Margin** Required  
    - **Money gives you the independence and options to choose**    
    - **generating multiple sources of revenue**    
        + **opportunities to expand revenue generation** and a setup for a future career move  
        + or part-time career    
        + **translate hobbies into income-producing activities**     
            - **pursue other interests** that could lead to a new career or your own business  
        + the needs of the future customers  
            - "what do u need and what are your problems with current products?"
