##### Negotiation skills  
* Preparation and Leverage  
    - Develop your BATNA - Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement  
        + The stronger your BATNA, the more leverage you have in the negotiation  
        + **Always improve your BATNA**  <- proactive, feed it, grow it  
        + Never reveal your BATNA to the counter-party, otherwise you lose your leverage    
        + **Signal** to the other party that you have **attractive options**    
        + Once you determine your BATNA, then devise your reservation price (a reservation price represents the exact monetary equivalent of your BATNA)  
            - bottom line  

    - Best Position Yourself to Succeed in Negotiation  
        + set target goal  
            - **interests** <- what's the most important to you  
            - market conditions  <- consider the counter-party's BATNA  
                + gain leverage  
                + research market and competitors  
                + think about counter-party's BATNA  
            - estimate **Bargaining Zone**    
          
        + make the first offer  if you are prepared  
            - anchors, predict final outcomes  
            - the ideal opening offer 
            should **be on or near the other party's reservation point**    

        + Immediately re-anchor if the other party opens first  
            - "thank you for sharing your ideas with me. I've also spent some time preparing a set of terms that would be very attractive for me. I will warn you that my proposal is different from yours but I offer it in the spirit in structuring a deal"

    - The Art of Concessions  
        + make large number of **small concessions**    
        + **avoid unilateral concessions**    
            - Never make two or more concessions in a row 
            - Negotiation needs to be a quid pro quo  
            - if necessary, remind the other party where you started and where you are now  
        + be precise  
        + provide rationale  


* Win-Win Negotiation  
    - fractionate the negotiation into **several issues**      
        + identifying other issues such as payment terms, conditions, volume, quality and money ... 

    - **prioritize your interests** for each issues

        + **what is your rank ordering of the issues**?    
        + would you rather I made a concession on issue Z or issue W?

        + If I gave what you wanted on Z,
        could you give me what I need on Y?  

    - **devise multi-issue proposals** that logroll parties' interests  
        + value-added tradeoff  


* De-escalate Conflict    
    - Conflict: people believe thay have **opposing** interests or beliefs regarding an outcome or process  
        + **interest  strategy** instead of power, right strategy   
            - separate the people from the problem  
            - attempt to **understand the needs and interests** of the other party  
                +  **ask "why" and "why not" question**  
            - don't focus on a single option, generate multiple options or courses of action   

        + **reward the use of interest** by the other party    

    - **bring conversations back to interests**, away from power and rights 
        + Don't get personal attack   
            - stop saying things like you are making me mad or you are so unreasonable   
            - "I'm frustrated now beacuse this is a really important matter for me"   

        + Send a Mixed-Message  
            - show other party you **cannot be taken advantage of**  
            - combine power and interests or rights and interests  
            - "**I'm sure that my management team would love to get involved in** this matter,  but **I'm more inclined to work this out** with you one on one. "  

        + solve conflicts face to face 
            - people like to use power and right strategies when they communicate virtually  

        + focus on ranking ordering    


    - use Rights and Power  
        + when the other party will not come to the table  
        + when you have exhausted all of your options  
            - "look I'm running out of optimism here. My goal is to settle this but **I feal that I might need to seek legal council**. Do you have any more ideas?"  

        + when the other party is not taking you seriously  
            
        + be clear about what actions are needed  
            - help parties "save face"
