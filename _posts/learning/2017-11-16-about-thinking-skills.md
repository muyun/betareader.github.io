#### Strategic study and thinking  

##### classify the problems  
* **define the problem**    
    - **how to best formulate a problem** 
    - **try to be more specific** if the problem concerns how a goal or target   
    - whether **the problem so-defined is real or not**  

*  classify the problem  
    - **empirical questions** -> concern empirical facts, particular events or causal processes in the world  
        + **need observations or experiments** or the help of experts in the field  
        + the prior beliefs **should be evaluated** according to empirical data  

    - conceptual questions 
        + conceptual analysis and reasoning is enough to answer 
        + without engaging in experiments or observations  

    - evaluative questions  - value judgments  
        + distinction between intrinsic and instrumental values  
        + consider **the consequences** of the action, or **the motives** behind the action  
        + once **knowing the empirical facts**, then we can **apply the correct moral standards to judge** whether the action is good or bad  


##### **solve problems**  
* understand the problem  
    - **is the problem well-defined**?  can the problem be analysed into smaller sub-problems?  
    - what type of problem is it?  
    - **what information can we gather** about the problem?  
    - **have other people solve this problem before**?  **what lessons** might their experiences offer?  
    - what are **the constraints** (time, money, resources,etc) in solving the problem?  

* draw up a plan  
    - carry out **necessary preparations**, like research, coordination  
    - **determine the time and resources needed**  
    - write down **the plan in a systematic manner**  

* try out the plan  
    - **monitor progress** to make sure that things go according to plan  
    - **record errors or special considerations** for furutre review   

* **monitor the outcome of  the plan**  
    - **review past experiences and understand why** we succeed or fail 
    - **monitor our own performance review the whole exercise** in order that
    we can do even better in the future  

* understand complex systems and processes  
    - **decomposition**    
        + identify the functions of different components,
        and see how they interact with each other  
        +  understand the function and behavior of a object in terms
    of **its components and their interaction**   


##### making good decisions  
* **focus on the process** of making a decision  
    - **emotions** are crucial in helping us come to a decision  
    - need to **listen to our feelings** because we often
    have to live with the decisions that we have made  
        + some of **our deep-deated emotional reactions** might come from
        those aspects of **our personality that we are not able to change**  
    - **the heart** has its reasons which reason does not know  

* use a pros and cons list  
    - good reasons or good consequences 

* spend more time thinking carefully about a difficult and important decision

#### creative thinking  

##### The idea of innovation    
* “It’s better to solve the right problem approximately than to solve the wrong problem exactly” - John Turkey

#### critical thinking  - 思辨能力  
* think clearly and rationally  

##### Why 
* 拒绝不恰当的想法，以**更加接近真理与真相**  
    - 尽可能求得最理性，客观的判断  
    - 帮助我们建立 严谨而扎实的推理结构，更容易令他人理解与认同  
    - 高级的 思辨能力是**公正无私**的  
        + **试图评论一切推理的真正优点与缺失**， 无论出于自己或他人  
        + **不会控制他人或逃避真相**，而是用 有道德，负责的态度思考问题  
        + 愿意聆听自己未必赞同的论点，**如有更正确的推理**，也愿意改变自己的观点或立场 

##### What - **think clearly and rationally about what to do or what to believe**  
* **ask questions and to keep asking them until you are satisfied with the answer**  
    - **inquiry to determine the nature of the problem** before proceeding to attempts at its solution  

* self-evalution 
    - evalute the pros and cons of your decisions?  

    - break down a complex problem into parts ?

    - do you have reasons for your confidence? 
        + do you have a way to evaluate your own thinking?  

    - do u take other people's experiences into account?  
  

#### think clearly  
* why 
    - pursuit of knowledge  
    - know ourselves a little better, dispel prejudices 
    - communicate more richly and persuasively 

* stage 1 - why you believe something to be true or important  

* stage 2 - the assumptions this reasoning relies upon  

* stage 3 - what you do and don't know, where you're uncertain
