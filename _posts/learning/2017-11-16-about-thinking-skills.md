#### critical thinking  - 思辨能力  
* think clearly and rationally  

##### Why 
* 拒绝不恰当的想法，以更加接近真理与真相  
    - 尽可能求得最理性，客观的判断  
    - 帮助我们建立 严谨而扎实的推理结构，更容易令他人理解与认同  
    - 高级的 思辨能力是**公正无私**的
        + **试图评论一切推理的真正优点与缺失**， 无论出于自己或他人  
        + **不会控制他人或逃避真相**，而是用 有道德，负责的态度思考问题  
        + 愿意聆听自己未必赞同的论点，**如有更正确的推理**，也愿意改变自己的观点或立场 

##### What - **think clearly and rationally about what to do or what to believe**  
* **ask questions and to keep asking them until you are satisfied with the answer**  
    - **inquiry to determine the nature of the problem** before proceeding to attempts at its solution  

* self-evalution 
    - evalute the pros and cons of your decisions?  

    - break down a complex problem into parts ?

    - do you have reasons for your confidence? 
        + do you have a way to evaluate your own thinking?  

    - do u take other people's experiences into account?  
  

#### think clearly  
* why 
    - pursuit of knowledge  
    - know ourselves a little better, dispel prejudices 
    - communicate more richly and persuasively 

* stage 1 - why you believe something to be true or important  

* stage 2 - the assumptions this reasoning relies upon  

* stage 3 - what you do and don't know, where you're uncertain
