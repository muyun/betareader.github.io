#### positive values  
#####  Aristotle  - a successful life is **a life of fullilled happiness**     
*  **happiness comes through achieving the best version of you**  
    - aiming at **the functional excellence as a virtue** according to the natural order  
        + everything has its unique nature and function in the nature order  

        + when an object **fulfills the function of its kind to the highest level**, 
        it achieves a sort of **functional excellence**  
        + **strive for functional excellence would be the ultimate purpose or final end** of the existence of anything in the universe   

    - **aim at the excellence you possess** is indeed the very source of your long-term happiness - eudaimonia  
        + an ultimate purpose for our existence in the universe is about **the development of our potentials and talents** as humans  

        + success belongs only to those **who manifest the virtue of character**  

    - **only people with the genuine excellence would achieve happiness**


*  **The Golden Mean** - **a balance between our rationality and our animal drives** 
    - **do it just right** 
        + do the right thing in the right way at the right time in the right place to the right person  
        + don't do too much, and don't do too little  


    - use **common senste** to start with, then we **learn through trial and error**   
        + **observe and learn from good examples**, and being excellence **takes practice**  
        + don't be disappointed at your failures  
            - **luck, good or bad, always plays its part**  
        + **take challenges as opportunities to cultivate your strengths** and work on your weakness 


    - **live a life of continual improvement**  (learn from your mistakes)
        +  **deliberate before taking any action** for a better and more appropriate result  

        + **evaluate and seek further ways of improvement** after taking any action 

        + **repeat the appropriate action and turn it into our habit**    


##### Immanuel knat - Moral values - right and wrong  
* The moral law is categorical imperative  
    - **thinking rationally** is the only thing that tells us what is right and wrong  
        + not god, not other people, not our gut feelings  
    - **the sophisticated reasoning skills direct us to make the right choices in life**  

* how can we **use reason to know what is right** 
    - Act only on "categorical imperative"  - **a universal law**   
        + **an unconditional commitment**  
        + avoid beging affected by any personal concerns or self-interests  
        
    - **a genuinely morally good person only if he acted unconditionally**  

    -  **Treat others as you want to be treated**  as a goal  
        + being moral isn't easy, but it's not impossible, it's a matter of free choice  

    - **need to know the intention of the agent** before you can make a fair moral judgment  


* how a moral life forms the core of a successful life  

    - integrity and honesty  -  lying is always wrong 
        + because lying couldn't be universalized as a moral right for everyone  

    - respect people  as an individual - **the humanity principle**
        + every human being has value in dignity  
        + do not use people **only as a tool for you to gain** something 
        + they are aleady complete - they are ends in themselves  

    - **respect your humanity**  
        + recognize and respect whatever is included in your humanity
        + cultivate your own talents
          
    - **self-love and rational optimism**  
        + **respect the value of your own life**  
        +  more than a tool to help you avoid pain or obtain happiness 
        +  **have self-love by looking for solutions**     
        +  **solutions are always there if you keep looking**  


##### John Mill - Social Happiness 
* **sustainable personal happiness** from the intellectual and moral dimensions   
    -  acquistion of knowledge  
        + keep your curiosity and a life-long learning attitude  

    - cultivate your creative imagination 
        + reading, watching, listening, doing yoga or meditation  
        +  become an active participant by understanding and 
            even mastering the tech of the works and activities so much so that **you are authoring your own aesthetic experience** from those creative works and activities  

    -  cultivate your moral sentiments  
        + **develop a compassion** for other people and humankind in general  

    - not only body pleasures  

* The happiness of the  greatest number of people  
    - selfish interests must be terminated by death  
    
    - happier not just for yourself but also for others  
        + cultivate your affection for your family, friends, community, and humankind
