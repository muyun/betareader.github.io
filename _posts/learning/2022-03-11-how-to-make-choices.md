#### Man's Purpose in Life  

* some basic principles of existence  

    - Acceptance of responsibility  

    - Perseverance  

    - **Strive for excellence** 
        + happiness comes from the full use of one's power to achieve excellence  
        + fill Life with achieving and exercising excellence  

        + **Mediocrity** can destroy us as surely as perils far more famous  
            - living with excellence

    - Creativity  
        + To find an undeveloped situation, to see the possibilities, to decide upon a course 
    of action, and then devote the whole of one's resources to carry it out, even if it means
    battling against the stream of contemporary opinion  

    - take courage to stand and fight for 
        + you have to start it over again each morning as the sun rises  


    - the development of standards of ethical and moral conduct  


*  **Life must be felt**, not observed  
    - **to create, to excel, and to be concerned** about the world and its affairs

#### basic rules  
*  **The Golden Mean** -  a balance between our rationality and our animal drives   
    - **confident yet courteous** (polite and showing respect)  
        + **knowing you're worth** and also be kind (humble and **don't look down on** others)  
        + warmth and competence

    - **appreciate the needs of the others** while we need to **advance our own interests and concerns**  
        + **too much empathy(feeling the other person's emotions)** making deep cooperation when they're likely to be exploited  

    - Trust but verify  
        + **think carefully about what we do not want to believe**,
    and **what we want to believe**, before we place our trust in others 
            - **establish a baseline (what constitutes "normal" behaviors)**, and start to ask pressing questions
            - **actively look for those clues** we hope not to find  


* **Concentration**  
    - become true to yourself  
    - **only concentrate on matters truly important to you**  


* Training your boundaries to be stronger than your heart  
    - **俗文化**： 显示的比实际的要弱一些  

* **Set yourself free from fear**  
    - already been living through the worst times  
    - the freedom would empower one to face failure courageously   
    - see this as an opportunity to be a new start    


#### THE Self-Awareness Onion  

*  **understanding of one's emotions**  
    - **identify blind spots** in ourselves and the **expressing the affected emotions** appropriately  
    - [2020-06-16-notes-on-the-love-skills]


* **why we feel certain emotions**  
    - why do you fell angry?  is it because you failed?
    - help us **understand the root cause of the emothions** that overwhelm us 
    - do something to change it 

* the third level is **what you value, and how you measure failure/success**  
    - **what standard I am judging myself** and everyone around me  
    - **our values determine the nature of our problems**, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives  
        + if you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success
    - "**why does that seem true**?" 
        + "why do I consider this to be success/failure?"
        + " How am I choosing to measure myself?" 

    - some good values  - **reality-based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable** 
        + the values are achieved **internally**, and can be experienced right now
        + good values: honesty, curiosity, creativity, standing up for oneself,nonviolence  
        + bad values: dominance through manipulation or violence, being liked by everyone, ...   

* **why** or for what purpose?  


* self-improvement is about: 
    - **prioritizing better values**, **choosing better things** to give
    - when you give better fucks, you get better problems  
    - when you get better problems, you get a better life  



##### making good decisions  

* Concentrate on the **few important ones**   
    - the problem is **a generic situation**, and could only be solved through a decision
    which established a rule, a principle  
    - **clear specifications** to what the decisions has to accomplish  



* **focus on the process** of making a decision  
    - **emotions** are crucial in helping us come to a decision  
    - need to **listen to our feelings**   
        + some of **our deep-deated emotional reactions** might come from
        those aspects of **our personality that we are not able to change**  
        + **the heart** has its reasons which reason does not know  

* use a pros and cons list  
    - good reasons or good consequences 

* spend more time thinking carefully about a difficult and important decision
