##### Note  
* Use **creativity** to solve problems    
    - **invest your creativity, skills and efforts into solve big problems** and waht free markets pay for it    
    - If the work doesn't require **creativity**, **delegate it, automate it or leave it**    



##### Focus - 把精力用在重要的事情上  
* 不是生活中的每一个问题都要解决，**和问题共处是人生常态**    


##### **Check -   Constantly ask yourself what you're trying to do**  
* **Always pick the simplest solution** that solves your immediate problem, then **change it when it is needed**    

    + keep is agile and adaptable; iterate faster  
    

*  **Constantly ask yourself what's the problem** you're trying to solve  
    + After we implement the simple solution, we **have a much better understanding of our problem**  

    + be sure that **you understand the problem deeply**, and that you **at least have an idea** of how would you know that the problem is solved  

    + Connect Goals to a purpose   
             
* **propose a course of action**  
    + start small and start now  
    + write down your potential obstacles, execuses, or fears, as well as how you will navigate them  
    + celebrate your wins on each step  

* remind yourself: what I was trying to do ?

* ask the question: does doing this solve my problem?  
    + doing this should transform your problem into your imaginary solved problem 
    + it's important to have an idea of how does the solved problem looks like  

* Do I need to do this?  
    + All actions should be needed for solving the problem  
    + Any action that is not obviously needed, should be discarded
