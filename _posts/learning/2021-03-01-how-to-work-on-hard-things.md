##### work on hard problems  
* Use **creativity** to solve problems    
    - **invest your creativity, skills and efforts into solve big problems** and want free markets pay for it    
    - If the work doesn't require **creativity**, **delegate it, automate it or leave it**    

* Focus on the matters  
    - 不是生活中的每一个问题都要解决，**和问题共处是人生常态**    

##### How To Do difficult Things  
* Difficult problems  
    - problems that are not a function of raw work hours, but rather require dealing with **ambiguity**    
    - you have to **put a lot of skill or thinking** into it    

    - hard work is just a lot of human-hours  

* Effective strategies 
    - **reduce the cognitive costs of decision making** to solve the problem through 
    **collapsing a high dim problem space** into a low dim of hard work  
        + focus on decisions where pretty much **anything you can do works**  
        + prioritize decisions that quickly **lead to good outcomes**  
        + **delegate to external sources** of decision making  

    - 减少选择性  
        + 优先级选择  

    -  skill acquisition  
        + access to a subject expert and know how to guide you through

##### **Check -   Constantly ask yourself what you're trying to do**  
* **Always pick the simplest solution** that solves your immediate problem, then **change it when it is needed**    
    - keep is agile and adaptable; iterate faster  
    

*  **Constantly ask yourself what's the problem** you're trying to solve  
    - After we implement the simple solution, we **have a much better understanding of our problem**  

    - be sure that **you understand the problem deeply**, and that you **at least have an idea** of how would you know that the problem is solved  

    - Connect Goals to a purpose   
             
* **propose a course of action**  
    - start small and start now  
    - write down your potential obstacles, execuses, or fears, as well as how you will navigate them  
    - celebrate your wins on each step  

* remind yourself: what I was trying to do ?

* ask the question: does doing this solve my problem?  
    - doing this should transform your problem into your imaginary solved problem 
    - it's important to have an idea of how does the solved problem looks like  

* Do I need to do this?  
    - All actions should be needed for solving the problem  
    - Any action that is not obviously needed, should be discarded
