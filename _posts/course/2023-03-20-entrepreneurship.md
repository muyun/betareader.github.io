        + **Assess barriers** to being a customer to see if there are certain **skills, access, awareness, etc** that
    makes the offering accessible to these customers, but prvent it from being desirable or accessible to others  


    - opportunity   
        + your frustrations  

        + problems in the community  

        + global issues  


* Filtering  
    - **fit**  - be a founding team that others believe in  
        + access each problem based on **how excited** you would be to work on it, and whether or not it **plays to your strengths**

    - user promise, over deliver  
        + focus on your target **customer's highest priority**   

    - keep it short and simple (just one sentence)

    - startup success is more about execution than the idea itself  
        + **after you've developed your solution**, you shouldn't be concerned about people stealing it.
