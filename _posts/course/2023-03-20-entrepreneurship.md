* TODO

    - [The Entrepreneurial Mindset](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:BabsonX+BPET.ETAx+2T2018/home)


#### Entrepreneurial myths  - **the pursuit of opportunity** beyond resources controlled  
* pursuit  - **the actions** of an individual entrepreneur - drive, focus, discipline, and balance  
    - Only open mind and willingness to learn  
    -  The best way to prove your credibility is by **making real progress with your idea**  

    - Success comes down to **executing on your idea well** and **finding the right customers** where you can solve their needs better 


* opportunity - **a better, cheaper, or more efficient offering** for the customer  
    -  You've found a great idea **if you can fill a need better** than what currently exists  
        + Success comes down to execution, don't need to find a perfect idea  

* Beyond rescources controlled - **managing the risks** of external constraints  
    - **Prioritize and manage your time well**   
        + commit until they've reduced the risk of the startup  
        + **find those 20% of things** that are going to yield 80% of the results   


##### Identify a purpose and problem 
* **Focusing on the problem** not the solutions - **No bad problems** to solve  
    - write down **all problems**  
    - ask "how might this work?"  

    - how current customers **aren't completely satisfied with their current** products or services  
        + Listen to customers in the market about **their frustrations** 

        + Is there a better way?  

        + Assess your competitors **strengths and weaknessess**  

    - look for **potential customers who do not have access or skills** for current offerings  
        + **Assess barriers** to being a customer to see if there are certain **skills, access, awareness, etc** that
    makes the offering accessible to these customers, but prvent it from being desirable or accessible to others  


    - opportunity   
        + your frustrations  

        + problems in the community  

        + global issues  


* Filtering  
    - **fit**  - be a founding team that others believe in  
        + access each problem based on **how excited** you would be to work on it, and whether or not it **plays to your strengths**  

    - Potential - give confidence that you would be **creating value** that you can capture 
        + access each problem based on **whether there is a real need with customers** who are desperate for a solution  

    -  Ask yourself **why you're starting a company** in the first place?  
        + **to be your own boss**, to change the world, to improve people's lives  

        + important to be **passionate about what you are working on**, have the **ability to execute** on it, and feel **confident in the potential**  

*  Teaming  
    - design - finding the right **complementary** co-founders  
        + shared vision and values - have a **common 'why'** 

    - launch - **setting expectations and norms**  
        + **know what is important** (and not important) to everyone  
            - motivations and values - what aspects of the project appeal to you?  
            - a bigger mission around the team can align  
            - working style - your preferences, commitments, personality  
            - roles and responsibilities  
            
        + norm - **an accepted standard or a way** of behaving or doing things that most people agree with  

    - process - **managing the culture** relative to norms and expectations  


##### Understanding Customers  
* **learn the needs and preferences** of your potential customers  

    - determine potential customers  
        
    - write **an interview guide  with a few open-ended questions**   
        + to **learn about their needs and ideas**  
        + leave room to **make it a conversation**     

    - conduct the interview  
        + Do not sell, this is **the time to learn**    

    - analyze the data  - **find the key insights** from each customer type  
        + gender, age, and difference in **buying behavior**    
        + **develop a customer persona** - the one person within your target market  
        + **list out everything you know**  


* what to do  
    - Focus on **the need**, not the solution  

    - Bias - you are there **to uncover a need**, not there to validate what you think  

    - Do it **in person**, one at a time - this will allow you to pick up on **cues from gestures and facial expressions**  

    - Ask open-ended questions - this **makes it a conversation** and allows you to get to more depth of the need you may not have thought about before  
        + **how do u do** things now?  
        + **how do u wish you** did things?  
        + what u think can **bridge the gap**?  

    - listen much more than you talk  

    - **understand their priorities**  

    - get subjects to tell a story  
 

##### Designing your offering 
* Use surveys to determine **the most important dimension to your customers**    
    - **Customer priorities**  - who is **paying for the offering**  
        + **survey** - test or learn about your target customers  
        + craft unbiased questions to **test your hypotheses** including
    **multiple choice, rank order, and open-ended questions**    

* Competitive positioning    
    - **commercialize these ideas** and consistently creating value for both the customers and your business  

    - list the things that your customer cares about  
        + **select just the top two things** your customers cares most about  

    - rate the competitors on how well they address the top two customer priorities

    - **access where you want your offering**  


* **Develop your value proposition**  
    - clearly identify your specific customer  

    - use numbers in the benefit, such as '30% less water usage'

    - user promise, over deliver  
        + focus on your target **customer's highest priority**   

    - keep it short and simple (just one sentence)

    - startup success is more about execution than the idea itself  
        + **after you've developed your solution**, you shouldn't be concerned about people stealing it.  


##### Testing your offering  - prove the value of the service first  

* MVP - minimum viable product - and how to develop it  
    - **test just the core functionality** of your offering to see **if customers will change behavior**  
        + the product or service  
            - **prototyping your product's core functionality to test the concept** as simply as possible  

        + **the customer behavior**  

* Customer acquistion - the channels and methods for selling  

* Elevator pitches  
    - why - statement of purpose  
    - how with your value proposition  
        + strategy to achieve it  
    - what - the resulting offering
