#### TODO  
* CHECK 
    - HSBC MasterCard Debit Card  
        + TODO  


#### Ideas  
* **Wealth is assets and business that can earn** while you sleep  
    - the purpose of wealth is **freedom**  

    - **ethical wealth creation makes abundance for everybody**  
        + it's **a positive sum game** but **there are competitive elements** to it  
        + the modern industrial economies are much more heavily wealth-based societies  

  
    - Overall capitalism (Free markets) are **intrinsic to the human species**  
        + the notion of **exchange**, and **keeping track of credits and debits** is built to us as flexible social animals    
        + **keeping track of credits and debits** lets us **cooperate**  
            - who put in how much work?  
            - who contributed how much?  

        + Capitalism is actually good
            - it gets hijacked by **improper yields**, where you have **corruption**, or you have **monopolies**  
            - 商人被污名化 - 官商 - （垄断+腐败）   

    - Money is how we transfer wealth  
        + money is **social credits**; it's **the ability to have credits and debits of other poeple's time**  

    - Status is your rank in the **social hierarchy**         
        + stauts is a zero-sum game; to win you have to put somebody else down   
        + politics is an example of a status game  


* **You won't get rich renting out your time**    
    - you can't earn **non-linearly**  
        + your inputs are matched to your outputs  
        + you are replaceable because you're now **doing a set role**    
            - you're not being creative   
    - they're just **not gonna pay you enough**  
        + they pay you the bare min that thay have to, to get you to do their job   
        + they take on the risk, the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand 
  
    - You must **own equity** to gain your financial freedom  
        + the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors  


    - You want **a career where your inputs don't match your outputs**  
        + **Tools and leverage** are what create the disconnection between inputs and outputs  
            - look for **things** that are leveraged  
            - the higher the **creativity component** of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs  


    - Ideally, **make your money in discrete lumps**  
        + your own lifestyle does not have a chance to adapt quickly  
        + have much more creative expression, and much less about money  


* You will get rich by **giving society what it wants,but doesn't yet know how to get at scale**      
     - **Society always wants new things**, and society will pay you for creating things that it wants  
        + But society doesn't yet know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn't nee you  

        + figure out **what you can provide**, figure out **how to build that**, and then they figured out **how to scale it**  

    - **Bring the high end to the mass market**   
        + distribute what rich people used to have to everybody  

        + **Entrepreneurship**  
            - predict that society will want it  
                + you create it just because you want it  

            - figure out how to scale it  
                + how to get it to other people in a profitable way, in a self-sustaining way  


*  The Internet allows you to **scale any niche interest**    
    - you can now reach everyone  

* **Play longterm games with longterm people**  
    - all the benefits in life come from **compound interests**  
    - in a longterm game, it's **positive sum**  
        + high trust will make it easier to play the game  
        + important to pick an industry/city where you can play long-term games, and with long-term people  

    - get traction, and never fall back  

  
* Pick partners with **high intelligence, energy and integrity**   
    - some who is smart **at that thing**  
    - some who is **motivated** (hard working)  
        + delegation - someone **wants to do what you want them to do**    
    - **high-integrity**  
        + **Integrity is what someone does**, despite what they say they do  
            - cheat  
        + **self-esteem** is the reputation that **you have with yourself**    
            - self-esteem is to your own internal moral code of ethics  

        + pay attention to **subtle signals**  
            - Signals are what people do despite what they say    

    - Partner with **rational optimists**  
        +  you have to see the world for what it really is  
        +  you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done  

        + have an **action bias** towards getting what you want  
            - **just do things**  
                + figure out if sth is viable or not by **doing it**  
                + at least do the first step, and the second step, and **then decide**    
            - **Either lead, follow, or get out of the way**  

        +  Don't partner with pessimists and cynics  
            - modern society is far, far **safer**  
            - their beliefs are self-fulfilling  
            - they just wanna tell you why the thing is not going to work  


* Arm Yourself with Specific Knowledge  
    - Specific Knowledge is **the knowledge that you care about**  
        + specific knowledge is found more by pursuing your innate talents,
        your genuine curiosity, and your passion  
        + your specific knowledge is often **observed** by other people **who know you well and revealed in situations rahter** than something that you come up with  
            - **look back on your own life and see what you're actually good at**  

        + look at what you have already built by that point, and then **you can build on top of it**  

        + follow your own obsession, and keep an eye out for the commercial aspects of it  

* builder and seller  
    - CTO  
        + builder  
        + understand enough  
    - CEO  
        + selling: marketing, communicationg, recruting, inspiring people  ...  
        + speaking skills - persuasive and communicative  
            - writing skills  
            - sales skills actually scale better over time  
           
        
* **reading** is the foundation for your self-education    
    - you need creativity, you **need the ability to feed your own brain to learn whatever you want**    
    - **take your natural path** and **just read the things that interest you** until you kind of understand them  

    - **read the original scientific books** in a field  
        + the foundations are Math and Logic  
            - when you understand **the scientific method**, then you can understand how to separate truth from falsehood 
        + you can absorb what is true, you can reject what is false, and **you have a basis for even working that out that is logical and scientific** and not purely just based on opinions  
        
    - **understanding that comes through repetition and through usage and through logic and foundations** that really makes you a smart thinker  

    - foucs on the foundations  
        + basic concepts from game theory, psychology, ethics, math, computers, and logic will serve you much better  

    - you can **learn better by doing iterations** on the job  


* **Embrace Accountability** to get leverage  
    - accountability is results-focused  
    - build up **credibility** to get following labors and money  

    - in modern society, **the downside risk is not that large**    


* You need **specific knowledge and accountability** and **you have a good name** in that domain      
    - then people are going to give you capital as a form of leverage that you can use to then go get more capital  
    - Labor and Capital are old leverage  
    - **want the min amount of people working with you** that are going to allow you to use the other forms of leverage  

    - Capitcal as a leverage because it **feels unfair**, and nobody else around them or necessarily sharing in it  


* **Software and media** are New Leverage   
    - tech startups 
        + **robot**, and code lets you tell them what to do  

    - coding, writing books, podcasts/youtubing, are **permissionless**    
        + you don't need anyone's permission to do them  
        + for labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you; 
          for capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest  

    - **code and media turns into a positive sum game**    
        +  creating wealth with product leads to **more ethical wealth**  
            - **those products are equally available to everybody** as opposed to trying to create your wealth through labor or capital  

        + with the largest budget, you get the highest quality  
            - it's the nature of code and media output that the same product is accessible to everybody

#### 投资策略  
* notes
    - 要遵守**纪律** 
    - 以财务为第一标准, 潜力为第二标准  
    - 定期重新调整  
       + 定期卖出部分“表现出色”的资产，并买入一些“表现落后”的资产  

    - **要多交流**, 而不是自己一个人苦想  


    - TODO  
       + how to measure a good stock  

* **长远投资策略** 较少忧虑市场波幅
    - **股市升跌時正常現象**, 波幅不應成為決定性因素

    - 在市况波动期间保持投资 通常投资表现有利


* 投资关键在于**长时间投资**, 而非捕捉时机投资
    - 在市场波动期间保持投资, 通常可受惠于市场长远的上行趋势  
    - 拥有明确投资计划投资者则会更好的严格遵守投资纪律**按部就班的对投资组合进行再平衡或者简单的持股不动**    
    - 定期进行的资产配置再平衡也会让投资者对自身的风险偏好进行定期自测：如果股票跌10%，我是否可以继续以平和的心态持有当前的投资组合？如果没有问题的话，那跌20%呢？  


* **把收益再投资**以提高总回报
    - 透过**复利增长效应**, 股息再作投资长远课显著提高总回报
    - 切记验收 **投资纪律和保持耐心**

* **分散投资**  
    - **一个地区多元化且大类资产多元化的投资组合**会帮助投资者减少来自于某个地区或者某个股市的短期冲击  
    - 在这个基础上定期进行组合中各类资产的再平衡也是有益于实现长期投资更好收益的方式  

* 定期累计
    - **平均成本法**, 以较低金额定期进行投资, 有助降低投资平均成本  


##### 特殊目的收购公司(SPAC)  
* 空白支票公司是**已经上市的空壳公司**，他们与非上市公司合并，使合并对象能够绕开首次公开募股(IPO)实现上市


##### **可转换债券**   

##### **期权** Option - 买卖的**决定权**
* 投資者付出期權金買入期權


##### 年化報酬率
*  投资报酬率(%)  = (股票总净值 +  股息) / 總投入資金

*  **年化報酬率 (%)**  = (总报酬率+1)^(1/年数) - 1
    - 总报酬率 = (现股价-原股价) / 原股价

* 殖利率 - Dividend yield  = 股息(股票今年現金股利) / 當初買的股價
    - 殖利率不考慮當初 **投入資本價值增減**



##### 债券 与 投资 
经济环境转差时, 投资者偏好 投资级别债券 (风险低, 稳定).

当利率下降或预期下降时, 高收益债卷的价格升幅 很可能低于投资级别债券.


##### 利率, 价格, 通胀 
利率是借贷的成本， 当通胀上扬（物价上涨，货币购买力下降）的时候， 
利率会上升（借贷成本上升）， 则未来的回报前景不及短期内更确定的现金流有价值    

利率由央行制定, 会影响 借贷成本和储蓄回报; 央行的决策会以利率来控制 通胀和经济增长 (利率低, 銀行存款收息回報隨之减少, 可以刺激民众借贷和消费, 从而带动经济增长和通胀上升; 则加息可以抑制通胀. <small> why? 通胀 是指**货币发行数量上升**; 加息即 利率高, 銀行存款收息回報隨之提高，債券價格可因此下跌; 加息则 借贷成本和储蓄回报上升, 抑制民众借贷和消费, 货币流通就降低 进而抑制通胀. </small>)  

##### 债券 与 利率, 通涨
利率上升, 和通胀 都可能对投资者 的债券构成负面影响.

債券孳息主要由兩部份組成：利率和信貸息差; 如果市场预料利率将会下降, 债卷孳息亦会下降, 促使债卷价格上升  (<small>  利率／孳息和價格之間的反向關係; why? 当利率下降时, **已有的债券 会变得比新发行的债券更有吸引力** (因为利率低), 从而价格上升 </small>)

如果**通涨**上升 (利率持平或上升), 债券价值便早蚕食, 削弱票息的吸引力.


以年份來顯示債券的存續期; **存续期 反映债券对利率变动的敏感度**.
通常 到期日最長, 而且票息最低的债券对利率变动最敏感(why?  因为存续期较长; )

##### 债券  - 到期收益率  r -> 年平均收益率
債券價格與到期收益率呈現相反走勢的原因

當前的價格 P = (票息率) / (1 + r) + (票息率) / (1 + r)2 + 1000 /(1 + r)2

怎么计算收益率? 


##### EPS = Earnings per share
* EPS 是公司获利的指标 

##### Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market.

##### 市盈率  PE = Price-to-Earning Ratio  
* PE = 每股市价 / 每股盈利
    - PE 越低, 代表投资者能以相对较低的价格购入股票


##### 市帳率/市净率  PB = Price-to-Book Ratio  
*  PB = 每股市价 / 每股净资产  
    - 在评估高风险企业, 当资产大量为实物资产的时候
    - PB 越低, 代表投资者能以相对较低的价格购入


##### 股息率  Dividend yield
* 股息率 = 過去12個月每股派息金額／股價 × 100%
