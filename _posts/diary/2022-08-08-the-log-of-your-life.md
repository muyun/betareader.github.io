### a long-running note  
*  this allows you to look back and see how things turned out  

#### logs  

#### **Decision-Making**    

* the effective decision  
    - trackle a problem at **the highest level of conceptual understanding**   
    - try to **develop a principle for dealing with it**      
    - the action to carry it out is **close to the working level and simple**      

* the elements of the decision process  
    - find the **true problem** -> classify the situation - **generic or an exception** ?  
    - define the specification and set **Satisfy the boundary conditions** -> **这个决策希望达成什么目标? 或满足什么需求?**    
        + **the purpose of** is ...     

    - **start out with what is right** rather than what is acceptable precisely  
        + one always has to **compromise in the end**    

    - **convert the decision into action**    
        + 谁该知道这个决策   
        + 应该采取什么行动  
        + 谁要采取那个行动  
        + 行动的内容应该如何规划, 才能让必须采取行动的人胜任  

    - **feedback** provide a continuous testing, against actual events  

#### Effective Decisions   

*  think the specifications     

* **encourage opinions**  
    - they **start out with an opinion** not a fact  
    - **"What do we have to know to test the validity of this hypothesis?"**    
        + people who voice an opinion **also take responsibility for defining what factual findings** can be expected and should be looked for 

    - **"What is the criterion of relevance?"**    
        +  go into find **the appropriate measurement**  

*  **explore the alternatives**   
    - start out with the commitment to **find out why people disagree**    
        + **concerned first with understanding**  
        +  conflicting views, the dialogure between diff view, the choice between diff judgments  

    - **develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding** of what the decision is all about  
        + **the right decision demands adequate disagreement**  
        + disagreement alone can **provide alternatives to a decision**  
        + disagreement is needed to **stimulate the imagination**  -> **a new and diff way of perceiving and understanding**    

    - use **conflict of opinion as his tool to make sure all major aspects** of an important matter are looked at carefully   
      

*  **weigh the risks and gains**     
    - "Is a decision really necessary?"   
    - act if **benefits greatly outweigh cost and risk**   
    - **act or do not act; but not half-action**     
    

*  a decision requires **courage** as much as it requires judgment    
    - "**Is there any reason to believe that additional study will produce any new** "  
    - **will not rush into a decision unless he is sure he understands it**    

* Executives are not paid for doing things they like to do  
    - **they are paied for getting the right things done**
